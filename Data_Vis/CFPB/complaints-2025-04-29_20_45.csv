11/03/24,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"I am writing to formally request the discharge of all student loans held by XXXX  due to the companys deceptive practices, misrepresentation, and failure to provide proper guidance regarding my loan repayment options. XXXX  misled me by steering me away from income-driven repayment plans, which would have made my payments more affordable and eligible for eventual forgiveness. Instead, I was repeatedly encouraged to enter forbearance or deferment, causing my loan balance to balloon due to capitalized interest. This manipulation has led to years of financial strain and has profoundly affected my ability to meet my financial obligations. Also, XXXX  has a history of misreporting my payment status to credit agencies, severely damaging my credit score. The misinformation provided by their representatives has delayed my pursuit of more favorable repayment options and contributed to an overwhelming amount of accrued debt, well beyond what I originally borrowed. These tactics are consistent with the widespread fraudulent behavior for which XXXX  has been sued by numerous states and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ). XXXX  conduct has caused me significant financial harm, mental distress, and a long-term burden that could have been avoided with honest and fair guidance. As a borrower who relied on XXXX advice and entrusted them to manage my student loans, I believe I am entitled to be fully discharge all related debts. Their misconduct has created an unjust financial situation, and I ask that my loans be fully forgiven. Thank you for considering my request. I hope the CFPB will swiftly and decisively take action to hold XXXX  accountable and provide the relief borrowers like me desperately need.",None,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",NY,11429,None,Consent provided,Web,11/26/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,10668781

Secondly, I feel i was a victim of XXXX XXXX tactics to steer me into forbearances when there were other options. Most of this happened at the beginning of XXXX  and throughout the following years. If i called them and was unable to make XXXX payment or a full payment, they would steer me into a forbearance without offering me any other options for months at a time.

09/18/24,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Don't agree with the fees charged,"Well this is a long history of unorganized and in my an unfair money grab scheme. I have always done my best to make my payments, with that being said there have been some tough patches financially for me through out the many many years of dealing with my student loans. Although, 90 % of the time I always make my payments. Sometimes a couple days late but always make the payment. It just never seems like the amount goes down like it should, when I pay over {$300.00} a month year after year you would think it would be noticeable but its not. Below I will list the many frustrations over the many years I have had to deal with when trying to figure out how to navigate the best re-payment plan for myself. 
- Over the past XXXXyears or so I have had to put my loans into either forbearance or deferment several times and was always charged a ridiculous amount of fees, which I thought was not right considering the reason for forbearance is one is struggling financially. 
- When I asked the company what my options were for some temporary repayment relief I was always put directly into forbearance or deferment immediately in which I have used both over the many years paying fees and not realizing the interest accrual. 
- Late fees became a norm for me only because of how my payday landed bi-weekly from my employer, but the payment was made only a few days late which in my mind one should not be charged a late fee in this case. I was making the payment regularly every month for years. 
- When speaking with individuals over the phone I asked several times if they could mail me a hard copy of my loan history because it just seemed like the balance wasn't going down like it should be. Several times I was told they can't do that and several other instances they said "" sure no problem '' but I never received the documents. 
Overall, I am not sure what is going on here with the company "" Navient '' but my balance seems like its never ending for some reason even after years and years of repaying.",None,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",MI,494XX,None,Consent provided,Web,09/18/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,10166865

12/19/24,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Struggling to repay your loan,Problem with your payment plan,"Improper Forbearance Steering, Missing Loan History, and Financial Harm Dear CFPB, I am submitting this complaint regarding improper and deceptive loan servicing practices by Navient and now XXXX, which have caused ongoing financial harm. After Navient transitioned my loans to XXXX, my complete loan servicing history has been lost, and I am unable to verify critical details regarding payments, forbearance periods, and accrued interest. 

Issue Overview : While Navient serviced my loans, I frequently contacted them for assistance during financial hardship. Rather than offering XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) plans, which would have been a more appropriate solution, Navient steered XXXX into forbearance repeatedly. This practice increased my loan balance significantly due to capitalized interest and prolonged my repayment timeline unnecessarily. 
After Navient transferred my loans to XXXX, my detailed servicing history disappeared, leaving me with no way to confirm the accuracy of my loan balances or repayment status. 
XXXX has continued to offer forbearance as a default solution without properly guiding me toward XXXX plans or forgiveness options. 
XXXX XXXX : XXXX XXXX XXXX : I no longer have access to my servicing records under Navient, including payment details, forbearance periods, and accrued interest, making it impossible to verify the legitimacy of my loan balance. 
Inaccurate Credit Reporting : Despite being in forbearance, Navient reported XXXX late payments, which remain on my credit report and continue to harm my credit score. 
Ballooning Loan Balances : Due to repeated forbearance periods under Navient, my loans accrued significant interest that was capitalized, unnecessarily increasing my total debt. 


Context and Legal Precedent : These issues are consistent with the deceptive practices outlined in XXXX {$1.00} XXXX multi-state settlement in 2022, which confirmed that borrowers were frequently steered into forbearance instead of XXXX plans. The transition of loans to XXXX has compounded the harm by erasing loan history and perpetuating poor servicing practices. 

I respectfully request the CFPBs assistance in resolving this matter promptly, as the financial and credit damage caused by these practices continues to affect my life. 

Thank you for your time and attention. I can be reached at [ Your Phone Number ] or [ Your Email Address ] for any further questions or clarifications.

12/26/24,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"I write on behalf of myself, XXXX XXXX, concerning Navients unlawful servicing of their federal student loan, culminating in both negligent misrepresentations and unfair practices that have caused serious financial and emotional harm. Pursuant to the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 ( 12 U.S.C. 5531 et seq. ) and other applicable federal statutes, we respectfully request the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) investigate and facilitate appropriate redress. 



BACKGROUND Erroneous Forbearance and Withholding of Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) Options Navient inaccurately informed me that their loan was placed in forbearance. During this period, I was led to believe no payments were due, and that interest accrual would be managed appropriately. 

Navient further represented that, upon conclusion of this forbearance, I would be approved for an income-driven repayment plan, thereby reducing monthly obligations in line with federal regulations designed to ease borrower burdens. 

Sale of Loan to Trellis Without Adequate Notice Contrary to Navients assurances regarding an IDR plan, I later discovered that Navient had sold the loan to Trellis. No timely or transparent notification was provided. 

After the transfer, XXXX failed to communicate essential loan details, repayment instructions, or any path to the promised IDR plan. 

Charge-Off and Resulting Credit Harm Without mys knowledge or an opportunity to cure, XXXX proceeded XXXX charge off the loan. This action has severely damaged mys credit standing and made it difficult to secure alternative financing or better repayment terms. 

Relevant Regulatory Actions On XX/XX/XXXX, the CFPB announced a proposed order against Navient, permanently barring it from federal student loan servicing and mandating a {$120.00} XXXX payment for its longstanding, wide-ranging failures in servicing student loans. This order directly addresses Navients practice of steering borrowers away from IDR and into forbearances. 

In light of the CFPBs findings and other state and federal enforcement actions, it is evident that Navient routinely engaged in misconduct detrimental to borrowers, including myself. 

VIOLATIONS Based on the foregoing, we believe Navient engaged in practices that are : Unfair or Deceptive in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act ( 12 U.S.C. 5536 ). 

Potentially in violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and/or the Fair Credit Reporting Act, given the misinformation and adverse credit reporting suffered by myself. 

Contrary to Department of Education regulations governing servicer communications, forbearance approvals, and IDR enrollment procedures. 

REQUESTED RELIEF Retroactive IDR Evaluation That the CFPB require Navient ( and/or its successor servicer ) to review and recalibrate mys loan as though placed in a proper income-driven repayment plan when it was first requested or offered. 

Any interest capitalizations, fees, or additional charges accruing due to Navients deceptive or negligent conduct should be eliminated or refunded.

Credit Reporting Corrections Removal or correction of any negative marks resulting from the erroneous forbearance and subsequent charge-off, including the restoration of a positive payment history to the extent permitted by law. 

Reinstatement or Proper Transfer of the Loan If the loan remains with Trellis ( or any other entity ), ensure I have clear information on repayment options and IDR eligibility, along with complete and timely disclosures. 

If XXXX is unable or unwilling to manage the account in compliance with federal standards, we request an orderly reassignment to a servicer fully compliant with Department of Education and CFPB guidelines. 

Monetary Redress ( If Applicable ) Compensation for the harm I have experienced, including any excessive fees, interest, or other costs arising from Navients ( and its transferees ) conduct.

Given the CFPBs own enforcement actions, it is apparent Navients misconduct is both widespread and well-documented. We trust the Bureau will take swift action to redress the specific injuries I have suffered, as well as to safeguard against any ongoing or future harm. 



Please do not hesitate to contact me should you require any additional information or documentation. I am prepared to provide payment histories, correspondence, and any other evidence relevant to this matter.

My situation aligns with the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX findings against Navient, and I seek justice and remedy for the harm caused by their actions. 

As an XXXX from a low-income background with limited credit history, I took out private student loans with XXXX XXXX in XXXX, later managed by Navient, to finance my education XXXX XXXX XXXX. Despite consistent payments over 15 years, my total debt has increased by 51.87 %, with my current outstanding balance now totaling {$100000.00}.

However, XXXX high-interest private loans have unjustly excluded me from XXXX, XXXX me in a cycle of unmanageable debt and preventing me from receiving the forgiveness I deserve. 

Financial and Emotional Hardship : XXXX XXXX of my loans has resulted in severe financial and emotional consequences, including : Misleading Repayment Options : Navient frequently steered me toward temporary solutions, such as forbearance, which drove up interest without offering sustainable, long-term relief. 

Misallocation of Payments : My payments were often misallocated, leading to unnecessary fees, negative credit reporting, and additional interest. 

Credit Damage : XXXX inaccurate reporting and payment mismanagement have left me unable to secure housing, auto loans, or a mortgage, impacting my employability and causing significant emotional distress.

10/17/24,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"On or about XX/XX/XXXX, a student loan was taken out in my name if the amount of {$4000.00}. The current amount owed on the loan is {$11000.00}, for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX This loan is a fraudulent loan and is not my loan. I have never attended XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and have no student affiliation with them. In XXXX I filed a XXXX  XXXX in the XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX and all student loans were included in the filing to include this loan. Although the loan was not or is not dischargable it is still required to listed as a debt and is still subject to protection under the automatic stay. The XXXX  XXXX was XXXX in XXXX the same filing year. The only thing I knew at the time was that there was a loan serviced by Sallie Mae and I had no knowledge of this loan being tied to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX or XXXX. In XXXX I under false allegations from my now deceased ex husbands attorney was required to reopen my XXXX  XXXX and include certain parcels of real estate. This case was reopened on or about XXXX of XXXX and remained on the docket until XXXX of XXXX. Again all debts were listing to include this loan. Still having no knowledge of this institution for which this loan was obtained I assumed it was either for XXXX  XXXX XXXX or XXXX XXXX XXXX  where I actually did take classes and utilized student loans. During the course of the reopened XXXX  XXXX Navient now the serving agent of the loan continued to attempt to collect on the student loan and on numerous occasions was advised that the XXXX  XXXX was in place that this loan feel under the protection of the automatic stay and that they were in violation of the federal bankruptcy laws for attempting to collect on a debt included in a bankruptcy. Navient continued to report the loan past due and reported to the credit bureau this information and eventually dropping my credit score by the illegal and inaccurate information by XXXX points. Numerous contact was name with Navient and they refused to verify the bankruptcy information, refused to respond to cease and desist letters by my attorney and simply stated that they would not abide by the federal laws because they did not apply to them. All of the conversations are recorded and should be on file for verification. In XXXX of XXXX after an intense and accurate of XXXX documents provided to the bankruptcy court for a period of time covering approximately XXXX to XXXX it was determined that the XXXX XXXX was again a no asset distribution and was dismissed as such. In XXXX of XXXX I received a letter from XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX that they had paid Navient approximately {$11000.00} for this loan as Navient had reported to them that the loan was in default and XXXX paid to them the amount Navient advised was in default. I contacted XXXX and advised them that I was in a XXXX  XXXX from XXXX until XXXX of XXXX and they advised me on a number of occasions that they did not care. That they paid Navient that the loan was in default and that they were going to garnish my wages. Finally I reached out to the Ombudsman for XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, and told her about the situation. Her words to me were that my account was a mess and that there were no student records for me at XXXX XXXX and that this loan money was supposed to be returned to XXXX XXXX XXXX many years ago. She had me fill out an unpaid refund application and email it back to her. She advised me that she was going to approve the refund and that it would be sent to XXXX XXXX XXXX  to be processed. At this time the form has not been received by XXXX of XXXX according to their records and this loan has not been refunded to XXXX XXXX XXXX. It is still outstanding. I was not aware until XXXX of this year that this loan was for XXXX XXXX. This loan is a fraud and this money was embezzled or used for something other than education for or by me. All of this years I was never advised that this loan was for alleged educational use at XXXX XXXX. I have never taken classes there and this loan in not a responsibility that I am willing to assume. This was a fraudulent conveyance of funds either to the university which I was advised was suppose to return the funds and didnt or by the servicer who at the time was Sallie Mae . This loan has devastated me financially and has damaged my credit and has put me in a hardship. Had I known it was a fraudulent loan when I filed the XXXX  XXXX in XXXX I would have filed it as such fraud as it is with the XXXX XXXX  XXXX. I have secured a court date of XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX in the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  to file a motion to reopen my XXXX  XXXX and filed a motion for sanctions, motion to rule for show cause, and motion or fraud and or embezzlement if this matter is not cleared up and this loan removed from my name and off my credit report and these funds returned to the XXXX XXXX XXXX. I have also spoken with a consumer protection law firm and if this is not removed from my name will also be filed in the federal court for fraud and damages. This loan is not my loan. I did not take classes or benefit from the distribution of these funds/student loan and I will not be held responsible for a fraudulent loan.

My concerns stem from a series of issues, including : 1. Misleading Forbearance Advice : I was repeatedly placed in forbearance, which was misrepresented to me as the best option for managing my loans. This has resulted in a significant increase in my principal balance, which I believe to be an unfair outcome.

2. Incorrect Reporting to Credit Bureaus : Despite being placed in forbearance, my payments were reported as late to credit bureaus, negatively affecting my credit score.

3. Inability to Release Co-Signer : My co-signer passed away in XXXX  and despite my numerous attempts, I have been unable to have their name removed from my loans. This has caused unnecessary distress and complications in managing my loan obligations.

4. Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) Denial : I have attempted to apply for PSLF multiple times, but I was continuously informed that my loans were ineligible. I believe this guidance was misleading, and I may have missed out on a valuable opportunity for forgiveness. 
5. Ongoing Harassment : Despite my loans being transferred to another lender, I continue to receive calls from Navient representatives regarding my account. This is unacceptable and disruptive. 

I request that Navient takes immediate corrective action by : Discharging all of my student loans that were serviced by Navient, given the history of mismanagement and misinformation.

10/14/24,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"Dear CFPB, I am writing to formally file a complaint against Navient, a student loan servicing company, regarding their predatory and negligent practices that have significantly impacted my financial, emotional, and mental well-being.

I initially took out student loans to finance my education, expecting that I would be able to repay them responsibly with the assistance of income-driven repayment plans. However, instead of being provided with information and access to such plans, I was repeatedly placed into forbearance. This decision was made without fully explaining the long-term consequences to me, resulting in an accumulation of interest and a ballooning loan balance that I simply could not afford.

Navients practice of steering borrowers into forbearance rather than assisting them with income-driven repayment options has created an insurmountable financial burden for me. Despite my attempts to seek help and clarify my repayment options, I was met with inadequate guidance and support. This lack of proper assistance has led to severe financial distress, emotional turmoil, and mental stress, affecting both my personal and professional life.

The financial stress caused by Navients actions has left me struggling to make ends meet. The constant pressure to make unaffordable payments has taken a toll on my mental health, causing XXXX  and XXXX. I believe that Navients actions constitute predatory lending practices, as they prioritized their financial gain over the well-being of their borrowers.

Given the circumstances, I respectfully request that my student loans be discharged. I firmly believe that Navients predatory behavior and negligent practices justify this action, as they have caused significant and unjust hardship.

I appreciate your time and consideration in this matter. I am hopeful that the CFPB will take appropriate action to address these issues and provide relief to borrowers like myself who have been unfairly treated by Navient.

12/26/24,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"To Whom It May Concern ; I would like to file a formal complaint against XXXX XXXX for their improper denial of my school misconduct application. Despite Navient saying they are committed to getting relief to borrowers, their blatant refusal to properly review applications and evidence, but also their inability to give sufficient explanations as to why denials are being doled out, indicates they have very different motives. 
On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I received an application from Navient to file a claim of school misconduct in order to have my private loans XXXX. I was shocked, and very skeptical. Like a greedy, fraudulent, corrupt fox offering to guard the hen house, it seemed unlikely that Navient would hold up its end of the bargain. I mean, XXXX XXXX did conspire with for-profit schools to meet XXXX XXXX in cases where the schools otherwise wouldnt have been able to. But I had to try. So I spent the next XXXX  months gathering mountains of evidence and filling out the application in a way that was clear, concise, and left very little to interpret. After all, I didnt want to risk my application being overlooked simply because I gave them too much work. I laid everything out in an easy to read format with an evidentiary table of contents. I grouped pictures and articles and lawsuits as they related to each question asked in the application. Most importantly, I provided copies of my borrowers defense approval, screen shots of XXXX website, catalog, and brochure, highlighting and outlining their own contradictions and predatory tactics, and showing the tangible aftermath of my direct experience. That along with my application answers, would have been enough, if Navient had actually looked. 
I submitted my application on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. Even though the first page of the application said it would take up to XXXX  days, they requested I give them XXXX  days instead. So I waited. I knew the transfer of my loans over to XXXX was coming soon. So at XXXX  days, I checked in just to see if any progress had been made, and to verify that the switch to XXXX XXXX going to affect the decision. I was told there had been no progress, but the change wouldnt affect anything. So I continued to wait. When the XXXX  day mark came on XX/XX/XXXX and I still hadnt heard anything, I inquired again. Later that same day, I suddenly received XXXX denial letters in my XXXX inbox. Both back dated for XX/XX/XXXX. Since submitting my application, I checked my XXXX XXXX inbox, my email, and even my regular mail regularly, waiting for the results. So when XXXX responded on XXXX stating my denials were sent on the XXXX, I was confused. They hadn't been. I checked before I even reached out. But that wasn't the only thing that didn't make sense. The reason for being denied according to the letter was as follows : A variety of factors are considered in determining whether a private loan should be XXXX based on school misconduct and you do not meet the requirements for discharge based on misconduct by your school. 
In no way does this explain specifically what those factors are, nor does it explain what constitutes misconduct in their eyes. Furthermore, they offered no insight as to why the evidence I provided didnt meet those requirements, but that same, or similar evidence, when submitted by other victims, did. So I emailed XXXX again, asking for clarification. I have yet to get an actual response. 
As has been mentioned countless times by XXXX XXXX and other prominent lawmakers, Navient would easily be able to identify all of the fraudulent debts for borrowers who have been harmed without requiring any type of application, if they bothered to look. If Navient was really interested in addressing all valid misconduct claims, there wouldnt be any need for borrowers to apply at all. Inviting us to apply without providing a clear path to cancellation only serves to give them carte XXXX to deny requests, thus taking away any rights we have as consumers, as borrowers, to appeal the decision under the XXXX Holder Rule. This legal somersault should in and of itself open Navient up to an investigation by the FTC and the CFPB. This is far from being the first time Navient has tried to run a different play out of the same play book. There have been countless lawsuits pushing back against their aversion to accountability. I dont know why we thought things would be different this time. 
For Navient to say the discharge process is in the early stages despite having already denied a majority of the applicants, is incredibly insulting to those of us who have worked so hard to complete their confusing and convoluted application. This feels like nothing more than a ruse, a ploy to pretend they were willing to do the right thing, in an attempt to distract lawmakers and students, to keep us busy while they waited for all these questionable loans to move over to XXXX. Now that Navient is no longer the owner of these debts, and can no longer be held liable under the XXXX XXXX, there is no incentive for them to forgive fraudulent loans. This is an epic game of whack a mole. These lenders can abate responsibility by sending debts around to other lenders while the courts and govt agencies get mired in bureaucracy and red tape. At this rate, if the FTC and CFPB dont hold these lenders accountable across the board, justice will never come to those of us who deserve it. 
I suspect after I submit this complaint, any response coming from Navient, or XXXX, will probably come with a tone of condescension, as they have in the past. XXXX apologize and try to gaslight me into believing that they really did look through my application, and that despite all the evidence I submitted, somehow it doesnt apply to me. But Im not the scared, XXXX kid I used to be, I cant be gaslit into submission. And Im no longer alone.

I have been making monthly payments on these loans for well over a decade, have never defaulted, and have already paid beyond my original principal amount. I consolidated my loans through XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX. Ive included my most recent XXXX ( formerly XXXX XXXX ) statement. As you can see, these predatory loans have been hanging over my head for 20 years and will without relief despite recent court rulings continue for XXXX more. 

XXXX claims my debt is not eligible because it has been refinanced. They can rebrand their company and rebrand my loans as many times as they want, but the fact remains it is the exact same debt that others are getting discharged, and to punish me for being responsible about repayment is reprehensible. Of course, I expect them to seek out every loophole they can ; its how they operate, and its exactly why they have been ordered by courts to discharge so many students debt. The truth, which they acknowledge, is that they worked in conjunction with XXXX XXXX XXXX to mislead and defraud students, and that courts have already confirmed this as FACT. 

As demonstrated in the recent XXXX XXXX XXXX ruling, the school I attended during the years I attended has been found guilty of misconduct ( listed on the For-Profit School List on the XXXXXXXX XXXX  ). My story is similar to many students in the same boat : we were lied to and given false promises by recruiters and suckered into high-interest private loans through XXXX XXXX XXXX Of course the promised job placement never occurred. I received no help from the school, and in fact also discovered that theyd lied about regional accreditation. In short, like so many victims of XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, I was scammed. 

Because I did not default, I have not qualified for any of the settlements or lawsuits that have come up over the years directly pertaining to my XXXXXXXX XXXX, my years of attendance, and my exact XXXX XXXX loans. Recently, I was told I did not qualify for the XXXX AG Multi-State Settlement precisely because I had not defaulted. Ive been lucky in that many student debt groups have popped up in the wake of the XXXX decision ( XXXX XXXX, by the way, graduated from XXXX XXXX XXXX years after I did, so our stories could not be more similar ), including the Project on Predatory Student Lending, with whom I have also shared my story. 

It was on the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( there are so many victims that we have multiple social media groups to keep each other abreast of the happenings ) run by XXXX XXXX that I first heard whispers of a pilot program to aid in discharging these predatory private loans, whispers that offered me the first faint glimmer of hope in 20 years. 

There is now established legal precedent that my school acting in conjunction with XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ) lied to XXXX deceived, and defrauded students. In my case, this debt has defined the last XXXX years of my life, and at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, trying to survive month to month, while my top financial priority each month is my loan payment.

You are in violation of the law! 

As per federal law and the FDCPA, regulation under the following 15 U.S.C. 1792 et seq.15 U.S.C . 1692g, you are not allowed to propagate misleading information. Currently Navient is knowingly making false and misleading statements about my student loan debt. 

As per the XXXX Emergency Relief and Student Loan guidance from the XXXX XXXX XXXX ; all XXXX XXXX XXXX owned loans are suspended from payments, collections and default from XXXX XX/XX/XXXX through XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. This is solidified in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security ( CARES ) Act ( P.L. 116-136 ) and invocation of the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act of 2003 ( HEROES Act ). Based on these acts the XXXX XXXX XXXX put for the following policies : Accrual of interest on ED-held student loans and certain non-ED-held student loans was suspended from XX/XX/XXXX, through XX/XX/XXXX. 
ED-held loans were placed in a special administrative forbearance ( payment pause ) for XX/XX/XXXX, through XX/XX/XXXX. During this time, borrowers were not required to make payments on their loans. This special administrative forbearance counted toward the 120 monthly payments required to qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ), the maximum repayment periods under the income-driven repayment ( IDR ) plans, and the nine voluntary payments required for individuals to rehabilitate their defaulted loans.

Debt collection activities, including involuntary collection activities such as wage garnishment and offset of certain federal benefits ( e.g., Social Security benefits ), were suspended on ED-held student loans for XX/XX/XXXX, through XX/XX/XXXX.

I have told this lender on countless occasions this loan has tripled in the amount owed due to the daily compounded interest. The programs to keep my account current are useless as only a small minimum amount is going towards the principal while the majority of the payment goes to interest. This is a vicious cycle where if I don't make the minimum amount as set by the lender then anything less than is fruitless. These subprime tactics has not only caused me severe financial distress but my credit rating has lowered substantially.

10/08/24,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"Consumer Financial Protection Bureau XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Subject : Complaint Against Navient for Fraudulent Loan Consolidation Practices Dear CFPB Officer, I am writing to formally file a complaint against Navient regarding fraudulent and deceptive practices associated with the consolidation of my student loans. I believe I am a victim of misconduct and unfair treatment, which has resulted in financial hardship, stress, and confusion. 

Specific Issues with Navients Practices : 1. Fraudulent Consolidation Process : In XXXX, Navient encouraged me to consolidate my loans but failed to disclose all relevant details, including the associated interest rates and the true cost of consolidation. I was not made aware that the consolidation would ultimately increase my interest rate and overall financial burden. This lack of transparency constitutes a serious violation of my rights as a borrower. 
I discovered today, XX/XX/XXXX after speaking with XXXX who was the customer service rep with navient that in XXXX of XXXX a representative documented that I requested a consolidation on my student loans and submitted the paperwork to me even though I didn't request a consolidation. 


2. Unauthorized Signature by Third Party : Navient allowed my ex-partner to sign the consolidation documents on my behalf. As a result, I never had the opportunity to review or approve the final loan documentation. This unauthorized action deprived me of my right to informed consent. 


3. Misleading Discharge Notice : In XXXX, Navient issued a letter indicating that I did not owe payment on the loan because it was supposedly being discharged. At that time, I was under an income-based repayment plan. Unbeknownst to me, Navient converted the loan to forbearance without my approval, which compounded my debt further. It also made me ineligible to have my loan discharged. 


4. Current Payment Demand on a Fraudulent Loan : Despite the fraudulent handling of my consolidation, I have recently been informed that I owe {$1300.00} per month starting in XXXX. This new payment demand is both unjust and unsustainable, given the circumstances surrounding the origin and handling of the loan. 


5. Lack of Proper Disclosure by the University and Navient : I was never fully informed by either my university or Navient about the terms of the loan or consolidation, which was presented under false pretenses. I have also notified Navient of my lack of approval, but no corrective action has been taken.

6. Conflicting Information About Loan Repayment : I have documented proof that Navient representatives previously assured me that this loan would fall off my record by XXXX, and that I would not be required to make payments. I have now been informed that this is not the case, which adds to the confusion and points to a pattern of misinformation and negligence on Navients part.

I am providing this information to formally request that Navient be investigated for their actions and for relief from these fraudulent obligations. I believe that my case qualifies under the Borrower Defense to Repayment rule, given the misrepresentation and lack of disclosure at both the university and servicer level. 

I trust that the CFPB will take prompt action in holding Navient accountable and in ensuring that I receive the necessary relief. Please contact me if additional documentation or information is required. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Despite my repeated attempts to rectify these inaccuracies, including direct communication and provision of evidence to your the credit reporting agencies, the wrongful information persists. Under the FCRA, you are obligated to conduct a thorough and reasonable investigation of disputed information upon receipt of a consumers dispute. Failure to do so, as evidenced in my case, is a direct violation of 15 U.S. Code 1681i ( a ). 

I have never knowingly entered into any agreement or contract with Navient or XXXX, nor with any entities they claim to represent. The documentation provided by Navient in response to my request for proof of debt was grossly inaccurate, containing personal information and a name not attributable to me. This is a clear violation of 15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ), which requires credit reporting agencies to follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom the report relates. 

Moreover, XXXX has completely neglected to respond to my requests for validation, further exacerbating the issue. This non-compliance is an infringement of my rights under the FCRA and demonstrates a lack of due diligence required by law. 

The ongoing misreporting of my credit history has led to significant financial loss, reputational damage, and emotional distress. This situation is further compounded by the fact that I have been a victim of identity theft, a circumstance that has been aggravated by the widely reported XXXX data breach.

I have compiled multiple certified green receipts between these companies showing proof that I have repeatedly mailed via USPS documentation proving these accounts to be inaccurate, incomplete and not mine yet Navient and XXXX continue to willfully report this false information on my CONSUMER file. 

To date, the resolution of disputes I filed, most recently on XX/XX/, has been grossly mishandled. Notices from XXXX, for instance, declare the account in question as certified by Navient and XXXX without providing requisite proof. This approach not only contravenes the FCRA stipulations for accuracy and verification but also my rights under the Consumer Credit Protection Act ( CCPA ), which emphasizes fair and respectful treatment of consumers in the credit marketplace. 

The negligence exhibited by your organizations in handling my credit information is a clear violation of the FCRA, particularly sections pertaining to the accuracy and integrity of credit reporting ( 15 U.S. Code 1681e and 1681i ). This negligence has cost me time, money, and a significant detriment to my financial reputation and enjoyment of life. 

Consequently, I demand the immediate and complete removal of all false information from my consumer file pertaining to the alleged accounts. Should this issue not be resolved promptly and satisfactorily, I am prepared to escalate this matter by filing formal complaints with the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), the XXXX XXXX XXXX, the federal Bureau of Investigation, ( FBI ) and pursue legal action in the appropriate civil courts. 

I expect a written response confirming the rectification of these inaccuracies and a detailed report of your investigation findings, sent to me via the United States Postal Service, as a matter of urgency and legal compliance. 

Once again, I do not, nor have I ever had a loan or a contract with Navient or XXXX and am requesting a copy of the original contract in question, signature and ID used to verify the identity of the individual Navient and XXXX claim owe them. I demand a copy of the alleged contract with my signature on it the displays my information, signature and ID and if no such contract can be produced, I demand that these fraudulent accounts be removed from my CONSUMER file immediately.",None,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",AZ,85041,None,Consent provided,Web,01/10/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,8138001

It has recently come to my attention that there are multiple lawsuits concerning Navient Corporation, a nonbank that owns and services student loans. The Bureau alleges that Navient Solutions and Navient Corporation engaged in abusive and unfair acts and practices in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of XXXX ( XXXX ) by steering borrowers experiencing long-term financial hardship into forbearance, a costly option designed for borrowers experiencing short-term financial hardship, instead of adequately advising them about more beneficial income-driven repayment plans. 

I attended XXXX back in XXXX - XXXX and Im still paying on my loan as of today. The original loan amount was just shy of XXXX. My mother took out a loan and I signed one for myself at the age of XXXX to attend a trade school named XXXX XXXX XXXX located in XXXX XXXX. Ive been paying on the loan for quite some time until I ran into a long-term financial hardship due to a XXXX XXXX XXXX  I called Navient to see what could be done and they suggested that do a forbearance instead of offering me another low-cost program that would be cost efficient and conducive to my overall financial situation. This original loan of {$9000.00} is now at {$14000.00} and still accruing interest at an alarming rate! 

The Bureau also alleges that Pioneer and Navient Corporation engaged in deceptive acts and practices in violation of the CFPA and Fair Debt Collection Practices Act by misleading borrowers about the effect of loan rehabilitation on their credit reports and the collection fees that would be forgiven in the federal loan rehabilitation program. On XX/XX/XXXX, Navient moved to dismiss the complaint, which the court denied on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, Navient filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, which the court denied on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, the Bureau filed a proposed stipulated judgment and order, which if entered by the court, would require defendants to pay {$100.00} million in consumer redress and a {$20.00} XXXX penalty. The order would also, among other requirements, permanently ban Navient from servicing Direct Loans, prohibit Navient from conducting consumer-facing servicing activities for Federal Family Education Loan Program ( FFELP ) loans, and permanently ban Navient from acquiring additional FFELP loans. 

Due to the negligence and deceptive practices from this company thats been banned to even servicing loans, I ask that this account be removed as a courtesy and compensation for being misleading and causing a colossal financial disaster in my family. I tried to log into my Navient account today and it allowed me to retrieve my user name and a temporary password but when I attempted multiple times to login, the website stated that there was no account found!

I have been a forward XXXX XXXX in the XXXX XXXX since XXXX and have not been stateside to directly deal with the loans and have been relying on online pay and communication with Navient. On XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, I received a notification from the Department of Education about Student Loan Discharge Based on XXXX XXXX XXXX. "" Your loan ( XXXX ) will be XXXX based on an XXXX finding that The XXXX XXXX made pervasive and widespread substantial misrepresentations that borrowers relied on to their detriment.

My biggest contention with this process is that my loans were "" federal loans '' or "" federally backed '' when it best suited them and when a federal determination to discharge the loans due to misconduct was issued, now it is solely referred to as a private loan. Every single interaction I have with them they continue to refer to the loans as if I opened the loan with them directly.

02/23/24,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Co-signer,"I have a private student loan serviced through Navient, with a co-signer, from XXXX. Had the co-signer not been paying the loan off it would have been part of the predatory loan settlement brought by several AGs a couple years ago. 

The co-signer is my ex-step father whom has been paying the loan for over 10 years, and was told by a judge in his divorce with my mom that he is responsible for it. As a single mom, who is already in a legal fight to get paid the child support/alimony I'm owed, I am unable to make payments on this loan. He has been the only one to ever pay on this loan. Now that he is no longer married to my mom, he intentionally stopped paying the loan so that he could try to work a settlement deal with them. Despite being a XXXX. This is where I am finding it hard to understand if this is legally available for Navient, because on the promissory note it states we are both jointly & severally liable for the full amount. They told me today that they approved him for waiver based on him letting them know I can pay it, despite the tax return information I have provided. 

While I have heard of a co-signer release, I have never heard of a co-signer waiver. Navient has just approved for the co-signor to pay a percentage of the loan off to have his name removed without affecting his credit, then leaving the remaining balance solely on myself even though I have provided evidence of not being able to afford payments. Nor would I be approved for a loan without a co-signor, currently. The supervisor even made a comment to me about whether or not I knew this would affect me being able to take the bar if I dont pay it, once they remove him. Once the co-signer pays the 70 % of the current loan amount, more than double of the original loan will be paid back to Navient. Even more, they offered to settle the loan for less than what they are accepting for the co-signor waiver. 

I have searched everywhere on the internet for information regarding co-signer waiver, cant find anything. I have tried to reach out to the top executives at Navient ( CFO & Chief Legal Officer ), regarding this issue, I have requested a signed copy of the original loan agreement, and no-one will email/call me back. While I have been provided the promissory note, they will not provide me with the full signed loan agreement. I was yelled at over the phone by a case manager saying they can do it but not explaining how, legally, where it is stated in the loan agreement.

Under the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to Repayment ( BDR ) provisions and recent actions by the XXXX XXXX, I believe my loans qualify for discharge due to XXXX XXXX documented fraud and misconduct. 

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) has issued actions and a proposed order against Navient for improperly servicing student loans and engaging in deceptive practices with XXXX XXXX students, and the Federal Trade Commissions Holder Rule also protects borrowers like me from deceptive institutional practices. Additionally, the XXXX XXXX recently approved group discharges for XXXX XXXX borrowers under XXXX Action in XXXX, addressing widespread harm to XXXX XXXX students.

Here is a summary of my attempts to get clarification and protection from wage garnishment : XX/XX/XXXX : I submitted a student misconduct discharge form to Navient, but despite the HEAs Borrower Defense protections, I received no response for almost 60 days. 

XX/XX/XXXX : I contacted Navient customer service to request an update on my discharge form status. The representative advised me to wait but could not provide any information on the application review or loan status. 

XX/XX/XXXX : I contacted Navient again and was informed that my loans had been transferred to XXXX for servicing, without prior notification. 

XX/XX/XXXX : I spoke with a XXXX representative, XXXX, who confirmed that my application had been received on XX/XX/XXXX and was under review for a XXXX period. When I requested a written confirmation of this review to halt the wage garnishment by XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX stated that no documentation was available and advised me to contact the XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX : I contacted the XXXX XXXX XXXX and spoke with XXXX XXXX, who confirmed my applications receipt but suggested contacting Navient Charge-Off Department due to the loans being in charge-off status. 

XX/XX/XXXX : I contacted Navients Charge-Off Department, but they also could not provide documentation confirming my loan 's forbearance or ongoing review. I then followed up with XXXX, who reiterated that no documentation would be provided to XXXX XXXX XXXX to halt wage garnishment. 

As an XXXX XXXX student borrower, I am eligible for discharge under the XXXX administrations XXXX group discharge approval, which specifically applies to former XXXX XXXX students affected by the institutions fraudulent practices.

The Navient name and loan number are : XXXX XXXX XXXX Loan XXXX Loan type FFELP, initially HEAL I began repaying my loan in XXXX, after finishing my residency. In XXXX of XXXX, XXXX XXXX sent a document to me stating I could reduce my interest by a half percentage point by linking direct payments from my checking account to automatically pay the loan each month. Not trusting them from previous experience, I called and spoke to loan services two times prior to signing the direct deposit. I called to be assured that all this form was doing was allowing direct payment from my checking account on my existing loan, and that they would NOT call this a new disbursement and new loan, with a new 30 year payment schedule. I had already been paying on the loan for 15 years, and was finally at a point where I was paying some principal on it. I was assured, twice, that this was not the case. I signed the direct deposit form ( the only form I signed ), and they immediately issued a "" New Loan '' with a new 30 year schedule of payments that will last until XXXX. 

I would have completed my payment of the loan three years ago, if XXXX XXXX had not fraudulently "" signed '' my name ( a printed name not signed by me ), and "" issued '' a new loan. 

I initially borrowed {$36000.00} for tuition and books. I have, to date, paid payments totaling {$150000.00}, and still "" owe '' {$33000.00}. 
I have contacted Navient several times over the last five years. I was told I would need to file a "" Fraud and Identity Theft '' complaint with their internal fraud department. XXXX XXXX, in the years surrounding XXXX, when this happened to me, has been found guilty of falsely extending loans with practices such as what occurred to my account. 

I have written to the XXXX XXXX, and was told I would have to take care of it with Navient. Navient is unresponsive, and says they can't forgive the remaining balance of the loan. To be honest, at this point, I don't know who to turn to. 

When XXXX XXXX "" issued a new disbursement '' I demanded to see papers that showed I had "" asked for a new loan ''. I had simply signed a form to have the payments made automatically from my checking account. I never received any of their "" paperwork ''. 

I did, 5 years ago, find a somewhat sympathetic ear at Navient, and she was able to find the form I supposed signed for the new disbursement request. It simply had my name typed on it in the signature box. 

This is the heart of the matter with the current student loan situation. XXXX XXXX committed fraud, misrepresentation of information and documents, and identity theft in issuing a new loan that I not only did not request, but called them specifically to insure they would not call it a new disbursement. 

I would appreciate any help CFPB can provide in this situation. With the current "" loan balance '', I will be making payments into my late seventies, and will have paid on the loan for 45 years. I have already made payments of nearly 5 times the amount I borrowed, and the remaining balance remains close to the initial amount of my loans. 

Thank you for your consideration and help. Please let me know if there is any other information I can provide to you to help get relief from the remaining portion of the student loan.

The loan was for XXXX XXXX XXXX Navient has been used multiple times as a result of the actions that they have taken regarding these loans. They have been accused of payment processing errors and forbearance steering, resulting in higher fees and interest for borrowers. My loan should have been included in the original relief that was provided in XXXX with the Attorney General 's multi-state lawsuit. I was part of the original suit where each student was provided a check for an equal amount for the misrepresentation of payback options, I did receive a check from that, however when it came to for loan forgiveness due to predatory and misleading they did not include me. I contacted the Attorney General for my state and filed a complaint. In order to qualify it stated that you would have to have missed payments XXXX consecutive months. When the XXXX contacted Navient, they advised that my loan had never been in default. The information they provided is not correct. My credit report shows where I was continually reported for non payment. Navient also originated predatory subprime private loans to students attending for-profit schools even though it knew that a very high percentage of such borrowers would be unable to repay the loans. I was also advised that my Co-signer would be able to be removed from the loan, however that also has not happened. I have been paying on this loan that originated back in XXXX since that time however the loan has not decreased. In fact the loan was originally for {$4000.00} however it is now over {$8000.00}. I have been paying enough to keep it off my credit ( even though I can't afford it ) because I have worked hard to fix my credit that Navient helped to ruin. I am called multiple times a day regarding this loan and every time I have asked about trying to settle this loan, I was always denied. Every time I make a payment, the loan amount never goes down, it just seems to continually increase because the payment is going towards interest and late fees that I am steadily being charged. I feel as though my loan should have been included in the original lawsuit for forgiveness, however almost 20 years later, I am still paying on a {$4000.00} loan that is now at {$8400.00} with a 13 % interest. I just made a payment on XX/XX/XXXX of {$130.00}, however I am {$250.00} past due with a current amount due of with a current payment of {$120.00} due, and unpaid late fees of {$6.00} for a total of {$390.00} that they are currently expecting me to pay and none of it goes towards the principle, it will all be put towards interest and fees, so I am just spinning in a hamster wheel with no way to get off.

Background : I attended The XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX from XXXX to XXXX. During my enrollment, I was pressured to take private loans in order to secure my place in the program. The admissions staff misled students about job placement rates and expected salaries after graduation, creating a false impression that our degrees would ensure employment and financial success. 

Issues Faced : Deceptive Practices : The school provided misleading information regarding the job market, including inflated job placement rates and salary expectations. 
Financial Burden : Although federal loans have been forgiven due to the school 's fraudulent practices, my private loans remain a significant burden. The interest rates on these loans are exorbitant, and I have been unable to secure work in my field that pays enough to cover these payments. 
Denial of Loan Discharge : I applied to Navient for a discharge of my private loans based on the schools misconduct. My application was denied without any clear explanation, despite my understanding that other students with similar circumstances have been approved. When I contacted Navient for clarification, representatives were unable to provide a reason for the denial. 
This situation has left me in a precarious financial position, struggling to manage the loans that I was misled into taking. 

Request for Action : I urge the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to investigate the practices of The XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and the handling of my loan discharge application by Navient. It is crucial that students are protected from deceptive practices that lead to insurmountable debt.

Despite providing substantial evidence of institutional misconduct, my application has been denied twice without clear or justifiable reasoning. 

Loan Information : Loan Account Number : XXXX Application Reference Number : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX First Denial Date : XX/XX/XXXX ( Navient ) Second Denial Date : XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX ) Background : I am a former XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX, which has been the subject of multiple legal actions for fraudulent and predatory practices. The institution misled students about job placement rates, career outcomes, and the overall value of the education providedpractices that have been legally recognized. 

In XXXX, the parent company, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ), reached a {$95.00} XXXX settlement with the XXXX Department over illegal recruiting tactics. 

Following widespread acknowledgment of these deceptive practices, the U.S. Department of Education approved over {$6.00} XXXX in student loan forgiveness for former XXXX XXXX students, including those who attended the XXXX XXXX campus between XXXX and XXXX. 

Despite these clear findings, Navient, as the original loan servicer, denied my school misconduct discharge application without justification. XXXX, now servicing my loan, appears to have adopted Navients decision without conducting an independent or thorough review of the evidence I submitted.

Under the FTC Holder Rule, I am entitled to assert defenses against loan holders when institutional misconduct occurs. Given the legal precedents set against The XXXX XXXX and Navients role in facilitating these loans, I believe Navients initial denial was both insufficient and improper. XXXX  reliance on that flawed decision perpetuates this failure. 

Concerns : Primary Investigation Failure : Navients denial raises serious concerns about the integrity of its review process. XXXX  subsequent reliance on that decision is inadequate. 

Lack of Transparency : Neither Navient nor XXXX has provided specific reasons for the denials, preventing me from addressing any perceived shortcomings. 

Failure to Address Evidence : The substantial evidence I provided demonstrates institutional misconduct. The repeated denials suggest that my case has been ignored or inadequately reviewed. 

Requested Actions : Investigate Navients Role : I request that the CFPB conduct a full investigation into Navients handling of my school misconduct discharge application, including its review process and compliance with borrower protections. 

Require XXXX to Conduct a Fair Review : Direct XXXX to independently review my case without relying on Navients flawed decision. 

Provide a Clear Explanation : Issue a detailed explanation of the denial, including specific reasons and any additional steps I may take to appeal.

I have clarified through Email / Phone / CFPB complaints and internal messaging with Navient 's website what I am asking for. 

The School Misconduct Form is an unacceptable substitution because it doesn't adhere to the Holder Rule Notice in my Loan Agreement. The office of the customer advocate and the person that I assume is responding to these complaints told me that "" it was something different '' when I asked if this was inline with the Holder Rule.

03/25/24,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"I have 3 private student loans with Navient. Back in XXXX they were put into in school deferment status without my consent. When I re-entered school at least half-time, in XX/XX/XXXX, I checked Navients website to find out if I needed to do anything to prevent my loans from going into deferment, as I didnt want this to occur. The following is what I found : 1. On their Help center, Common Questions page there are two sections that speak about deferments. Both are under the Apply for section. The first, is A Deferment, the second, is An In-School Deferment. Under both sections it says for private loans that you must contact them at XXXX to see what options your loan is eligible for. 
2. In both of those sections the last line is a hyperlink ( one for private and one for federal loans ) where you can find out about deferments. I selected the private loan link. It brings me to a new page about private loan payments. On this page, if you select Deferment it tells you that to apply you must Complete a deferment request form and return it to us. There is no unique section for in-school deferment in this situation. However, the information in the introductory paragraph as well as the description of types of deferments both show in-school as a type of deferment so this information must apply to that type too. 

After that research I determined that there was nothing I needed to do because I did not want a deferment and their website indicated I would have to apply for an in-school deferment if I wanted it. 

I periodically check my account with Navient about every 2 months. Every time I would log in my payment would show {$0.00} owed. This is typical. When you select the i icon next to the payment amount it states that your payment amount will show as {$0.00} when you are enrolled in autopay. I have been in autopay for years now so this explanation made sense and aligns with what I expected my account to show during a normal payment period. 

On Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX when I checked my account I noticed the total balance on my loan did not align with what I expected. I looked further and realized my payments had not been taken out. I also realized that Navient capitalized interest on XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$220.00}. I immediately knew something was wrong and started searching my entire account and it was only after drilling into the specific details of the loan discovered by drilling far into my loan details that my loan status was in-school deferment on my 3 loans. I called Navient. I spoke to a representative, XXXX, and asked for a supervisor immediately because I knew this was beyond the practices of the front-line workers. 

The supervisor confirmed my account was in an in-school deferment status. She stated that in-school deferments were automatic. I advised her that this is contrary to everything on their website and detailed the locations where I had received all of the information ( as Ive listed above in this statement ). She reiterated it was automatic and that I should know that my status was in-school deferment because I was notified based on my monthly statements. I informed the supervisor that this was not the case. Statements do not have the loan status on them and that I actually do not ever get notified by Navient that my statements are ready, I just have to know to log into Navient, despite getting refinancing email offers from them on almost a daily basis. ( Unsurprisingly, on Friday, XX/XX/XXXX after this call to Navient, I received the first email in years notifying me a statement was available in my Navient account ). However, as I informed the supervisor, not a single section on the statement shows my loan is in a deferment status. Therefore, the information the supervisor was providing me was false. I also let her know that I have no specific documents in my Navient inbox ever telling me the status was changed as is customary on federal loans. 

I again asked how I was to know that this occurred. She only could tell me it was automatic even though there is no indication that this is proper practice for private loans based on their website. I told her that I find this to be deceptive loan practices and that I feel Navient is telling borrowers one thing while doing another that is more favorable for their income generation. I let her know the resolution I wanted was : 1. The {$220.00} of interest that was capitalized in XXXX was to be uncapitalized. 
XXXX. The interest that has accrued on the {$220.00} since XXXX should be credited back to my account. 
XXXX. My loan should be removed immediately from an in-school deferment status effective XX/XX/XXXX. 

She said she could not do the second one but could do the first and third. I still do not believe this is satisfactory but accepted as the first and third were the immediate concerns. 

She did not offer any information about when I would need to repay the interest or how quickly this would occur. I had to prompt for all of this information. She stated it would take about 2 weeks ( 10 business days ) to process and then I would get a letter in the mail letting me know it was completed. I asked how quickly I needed to repay the uncapitalized interest ( {$220.00} ). She stated I should do it as soon as possible because that payment will be considered delinquent. Although flabbergasted that they could call my account delinquent immediately upon rectifying their error I notified her I would check my online account in 1 week and make the payment on the uncapitalized interest immediately and then would expect to have my normal payments come out. We then ended the call. 

On Sunday, my cosigner ( mother ) received a voicemail from Navient that I was delinquent and about to enter default. I also received a call from a California number but was not left a message and assumed it was spam. Today, Monday XX/XX/XXXX I received a call from Navient and this time they left a message. The message was from XXXX XXXX. She let me know Im delinquent in the amount of {$560.00} on 2 loans. She said I have until Friday to clear the account, or it will be charged off to collections. 

There are a number issues here : 1. I have 3 loans. They have only fixed 2 and fixed is not the correct term. 
XXXX. The supervisor on Wednesday confirmed I would just need to make the payment for the uncapitalized interest ( {$220.00} ) not all of the payments since XX/XX/XXXX that Navient hadnt taken out due to their error putting my account in deferment. 
XXXX. I again was never provided any notice that I owed any money at this time. On Friday, XX/XX/XXXX I received a statement in my Navient inbox. However, that statement again shows I do not owe any money. Although that may have occurred prior to fixing the account I still have not received any communication from Navient other than a phone call threatening me with default in less than 5 days that there has been any changes to my account. 
XXXX. Navient is calling my account delinquent when I have not had any payments owed to them for 9 months. When I spoke to the supervisor, I did not ask for my deferment to be reversed through XX/XX/XXXX. I asked for it to be terminated effective XX/XX/XXXX. I am now again being penalized for Navients errors and deceptive practices. My account was in deferment status until sometime between Thursday and today ( Monday ). They are now also telling me they will be reporting this to the credit bureaus as delinquent. This is COMPLETELY unacceptable and false information. 

This entire situation stems from Navients actions violating the information they are providing to borrowers. Nothing on their website says my loan should have gone into deferment. When I notified them of this, instead of fixing the error by updating my status to remove the deferment effective immediately, uncapitalize the interest, and credit the interest accrued while that {$220.00} was capitalized, Navient instead back dated my repayment status to XXXX, called me delinquent on my loan, threatened default, required on 9 months of payments for 2 loans, and still left one loan in an in-school deferment. 

When I spoke to XXXX XXXX today, she said a supervisor will call me tomorrow. I then made the {$560.00} and she said they will for sure call me now by Saturday. Honestly, I believe a larger party needs to be involved. Nothing Navient has done to rectify this situation is appropriate. I have been penalized by their deceptive practices and now by their efforts to fix that. 

What I want from the situation : 1. My third loan that is still screwed up to be put into repayment with an effective date matching the day they do it. 
2. My two loans that are currently being called delinquent to be fixed to show they were in deferment until Friday XX/XX/XXXX ( as that is the best guess I have as to when they fixed the status ). 
XXXX. My credit report will not be affected. If Navient has already reported me delinquent. They will fix it immediately to show no payments were owed. My cosigners credit report should also be updated if affected. 
XXXX. I will be credited any amount of interest that was accrued on the {$220.00} since XX/XX/XXXX. 
XXXX. I will be notified by email and phone by an advanced Navient member when this is fixed. 
XXXX. Navient will either stop automatically putting private loans in an in-school deferment to match what their website states or will update their website.",None,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",FL,34654,None,Consent provided,Web,03/25/24,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,8616707

04/12/24,Student loan,Private student loan,Getting a loan,High pressure sales tactics or recruiting,"Back in the early XXXX  of XXXX I did a campus tour of The XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. I was given a campus tour of the cafeteria, the dorms, and the industrial design lab. From the outside everything looked normal. They even did a seated introduction to the programs, telling us about the 90 % job placement and work-study programs that they always had available. The tuition rates posted up on a poster were not even close to what I ended up paying. 
After the tour I headed back home to Delaware. Little did I know that the school tour consented to the financial aid offices, XXXX XXXX ( The Dean ) personally calling me and not just once or twice. The financial aid offices and the student advisors called me three to four times a week for five months until I finally consented and talked my parents into attempting to cosign for me. I had no credit and was told after running my credit that I would not be able to get a loan by myself. That is when Sallie Mae/Navient was pushed on to us. No other loan program was offered, it always seemed to be Navient that made it work. I was in the student financing office every three months for the three and a half years I was there. It was the most stressful process ever. We were applying for loans so often that my mother could no longer qualify to co-sign for me to finish school. My dads girlfriend at the time decided to help me for one semester ( Three Months ) and I was back in the office again trying to figure it out. They hounded me daily to come up with financing. At one point during my 3.5-year term I somehow managed to get a loan all by myself without signing any documents or being made aware that I was on the loan without a co-signer. I never made over {$10.00} an hour consistently the whole time I was in school. How I qualified for a loan by myself with barely any income and no credit does not make any sense. 
I went to XXXX XXXX to attempt to get a work study to find out that there was not any available. I was in the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  and with all the XXXX  companies in the area they had nothing available for me. With no work studies available I requested information on available jobs that they may have been aware of or that I could apply for that was within my scope of work. The lady told me that at this time there were no XXXX XXXX opportunities, but she has heard that XXXX was hiring down the street and I should go ask them. I couldnt believe it. The school that told me that they had a 90 % job placement rating and work study programs available at all times had nothing for me but to check out the XXXX down the street. 
By this time I was struggling financially, I had to go in to my financial advisor again to once again try to get a loan with a co-signer only to find out I had completely tapped out my Moms credit, My dads girlfriends credit and was in no position to be able to get one by myself and was eventually kicked out of school due to funding issues. I had managed to get 3.5 years in with XXXX credit and could not finish my degree. I was at the top of my class, on the deans list and honor society and I had nothing to show for it. I tried to hit the ground running and get a job but after the six-month mark when the student loans were not allowed to be charged, I was required to pay {$1500.00} a month in eleven separate loans at 13-17 % interest rate back. I hit rock bottom. I lost my apartment, I was homeless, my credit was destroyed and the only thing I could do was defer my loans with the accrual of interest rate over time. By XXXX I was over XXXX XXXX dollars in debt, with no home of my own, no car and a job that I was making {$16.00} an hour at. But Navient and Sallie who gave me these loans could have cared less. That hunted me, they called my family, my friends, anyone they could contact that could contact me. They called me 5 times a day. 
I fell into XXXX. Ended up having to take XXXX to keep my head up from all the negative thoughts that were running through my mind. I could not get an apartment because my credit was destroyed, I couldnt get a loan for a car, I was scared to get into a committed relationship due the how bad off I was financially and worst of all I was couch surfing. I had no home. This school was a fraud that prayed on me from the beginning. They sold me big dreams, easy payback schemes and the ease of getting loans and jobs that would make it all worth it in the end. That did not happen. And for the longest time I struggled emotionally and mentally to recover who I was. Navient/Sallie Mae played a big part in all of this. The XXXX XXXX and Navient/Sallie Mae worked together to get every once of money out of me and my family that they could. 
So, when I say this CFPB complaint is due to predatory lending, high pressure sales tactics or recruiting. That is just the small part of it that it all started with. There is also the problems with the interest rates that are criminal. The loan opened without my knowledge. The confusing and misleading advertising and the constant issues with financial aid. It should not be this hard to get a solid education. 
With all that being said I Submitted a Borrowers Defense Application on XX/XX/XXXX, and received confirmation from the Department of Education on XX/XX/XXXX. After researching my prior defense application, I found out my application was lost so I resubmitted my defense on XX/XX/XXXX. Which was part of the XXXX XXXX that happened. XX/XX/XXXX, I made a request for reconsideration. Finally, after all of that time and the accrual of additional stress and interest rate burden the Defense to Repayment was approved. 
Which was approved XX/XX/XXXX.

I asked them that they provide some kind of documentation with my signature on it where I indeed signed to attend this institution. 

I was sent a document containing my actual signature. However, it was to an actual institution I in fact was at the time and did attend. I called and explained this to them. And stated this institution ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) I never disputed attending. It was in fact another institution ( XXXX  XXXX XXXX ) that I disputed attending. They then provided me with an enrollment document as was the same kind they provided me with from the school I actually did attend. Although, there was NO handwritten signature on the document. It was in fact typed in. 

So, I then requested an investigation for this be done. Finally, a few months ago they agreed. They asked me to provide multiple documents. Which I provided what they had requested of me. After approximately 30 or so days, they responded that they have obtained an actual document with my signature on it proving I did attend that institution. I demanded to see it. They said they could not show it to me. 

I informed them that anything that they have in their procession that contains my signature, I have a right to have a copy of or see it. They told me they would not be supplying me with the document. I reminded them they had no problem with providing me the signed document from the institution I actually did attend which was handwritten and signed by me. Although, they can't by law provide me the same document they say they received from the other school! Why?

10/09/24,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"I am writing to formally file a complaint against Navient Corporation ( "" Navient '' ) for its violations of the Consumer Financial Protection Act ( CFPA ), the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) in connection with my student loan account.

I. Violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act ( CFPA ) Navient has engaged in unfair, deceptive, and abusive practices that have caused significant financial harm and emotional distress. Specifically : Misrepresentation of Loan Terms and Repayment Options : Navient provided me with incorrect and misleading information regarding the repayment terms of my loan, which resulted in confusion and an inability to properly manage my debt. 

Failure to Properly Apply Payments : Despite making timely payments, Navient has misapplied or failed to credit these payments correctly, leading to inflated balances and unwarranted fees. 

Unlawful Servicing Practices : Navient has failed to provide adequate support, transparency, and information on available repayment programs, particularly income-driven repayment plans.

These actions violate the CFPA 's prohibition against unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices ( UDAAP ) as outlined in 12 U.S.C. 5531.

II. Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) Navient has also violated the FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ) by failing to ensure accurate reporting of my account status to the credit reporting agencies. Specifically : Inaccurate Reporting : Navient has inaccurately reported my loan as delinquent despite timely payments, resulting in derogatory marks on my credit report that have caused me financial and reputational harm. 

Failure to Correct Errors : After notifying Navient of these inaccuracies, the company has failed to investigate and correct the erroneous information within the required time frame. 

Lack of Proper Notice : I have not received proper notice of the reporting or the ability to dispute the inaccurate information before it was reported to credit bureaus. 

These violations have severely impacted my credit score and ability to obtain new credit, in direct violation of my rights under the FCRA.

III. Violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) In addition to the above violations, Navient 's debt collection practices have also violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1692 ), including but not limited to the following : Harassment and Intimidation : Navient representatives have engaged in aggressive, harassing, and intimidating collection tactics, including repeated phone calls and threatening language. 

False Representations : Navient has falsely represented the amount owed and the legal status of the debt, causing confusion and distress. 

Failure to Validate the Debt : Despite my requests, Navient has failed to provide proper validation of the debt as required under the FDCPA. 

These actions have caused me undue stress, financial harm, and emotional distress, and constitute clear violations of the FDCPA 's protections against unfair and abusive collection practices. 

Conclusion and Demand for Relief Based on the aforementioned violations of the CFPA, FCRA, and FDCPA, I am seeking the following relief : Immediate cessation of unlawful practices ; Correction of all inaccurate information on my credit report ; Recalculation of my loan balance and removal of any improperly applied fees ; Debt validation and proper application of all payments made to date ; Compensation for damages incurred as a result of Navient 's unlawful practices ; Any and all other relief that I may be entitled to under federal and state law.

Navient misled me by steering me away from income-driven repayment plans, which would have made my payments more affordable and eligible for eventual forgiveness. Instead, I was repeatedly encouraged to enter forbearance or deferment, causing my loan balance to increase substantially due to capitalized interest. As a result, my loan balance has now grown far beyond the original amount borrowed, further compounding the financial strain. 

Additionally, Navient has misreported my payment status to credit agencies, damaging my credit score. Their representatives have provided misleading information, denying my requests for information on public service loan forgiveness programs that I may have been eligible for. This has delayed my ability to pursue more favorable repayment options and contributed to the overwhelming amount of accrued debt. 

These deceptive practices are consistent with the widespread fraudulent behavior for which Navient has faced legal action from multiple states and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ). The companys actions have caused me significant financial harm, mental distress, and an unjust long-term burden. 

Given the impact of Navients misconduct, I am requesting a full discharge of all related student loans. As a borrower who relied on Navients guidance in good faith, I believe I am entitled to relief from this unjust financial situation. I ask that my loans be fully forgiven due to the unlawful practices I have endured.

I'm not sure if you can help me or not, but I'm hoping you can steer me in the right direction. 

My original disbursement for the consolidation loans was {$15000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. The total I've paid to date is {$29000.00} and my balance as of XX/XX/XXXX is still {$5500.00}. I fail to see how I've paid nearly double the original loan amount over 22+ years and I still have a balance. 

How is this possible? I understand that the interest gets capitalized and adds up. But I would like someone to look into this and see if my payments for the past 22 years have been applied appropriately or not. 

I know Navient has been in trouble with the government recently and I expect I was just another young, XXXX college kid that signed up for student loans without any knowledge of what I was really getting myself into. 

These loans were for classes I took in community college when I was XXXX years old. Tuition at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in those days was {$42.00} per credit hour, but they automatically disbursed the maximum loan I was qualified for and the school refunded me the overpayment, and I was completely clueless about finances and assumed that was normal and that I was supposed to use it for books and living expenses. I did not expect that I'd still be paying for those classes in my XXXX when I've already raised kids and put XXXX of them through college.

09/24/24,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"I am aware that Navient/ XXXX XXXX have been sued by the government. I would like to let you know my experience with these 2 companies. I took out Private student loans for my 2 daughters starting in XXXX. There were 4 loans total, totaling {$59000.00}. The last disbursement was XX/XX/XXXX. I have been paying these 4 loans nearly 20 years now. I have {$24000.00} to go. On these loans, I have or will pay over {$37000.00} in interest alone. 

During these years of dealing with both companies, they have applied payments to the wrong account, received payment and not applied it, and then contacting me of my account being late. Example, last week I had a payment I submitted online 4 days before the due date. I got a call at work, which I did not appreciate. They told me that they had not received my payment, and I am late and need to make it now. I informed them I did make the payment, and did not appreciate them calling me at work. The next day, I called Navient, and they confirmed that they had received it, and had not applied it yet as they can hold onto it for 10 days. 

Even though they have been sued, it appears that they are still performing the methods. 

XXXX XXXX was even worse. To the point of exasperation at times. In the last almost 20 years they put my loans into Capitalized interest payments only 11 times. Yes, this has drawn out the amount of time I have spent paying these off. However, I thought it a good alternative at the time since it would give me a break in my monthly payments even for a short time. 

I have considered if there are any other options, such as, I have paid the original cost of the loan plus interest in full, can I get some sort of reprieve. But according to what I have read, none of that applies to Private Student Loans. 

I am XXXX years old and still working, in part because of these loans.",None,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",TX,75056,Older American,Consent provided,Web,09/25/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,10231872

At the time of my withdrawal i did not have a loan pulled, I was promised I would receive a loan by myself with funds going directly to me. I spoke to the financial dept. and the president of the school at the time of my withdrawal stating I did not have a loan and I was revoking any consent given prior as they had defrauded me. 

A loan was taken after I left the school. 

Sallie Mae/Navient refused to do anything when i reported the loan was taken without my consent or that of the cosigner. We were guaranteed no loan would be taken.

For the first 10-years all of my payments were interest only but I did not know that. I was advised to get into an income-based repayment from a Navient rep but they did not ever disclose to me that the payments were not going towards my principal. Furthermore- Navient doesn't provide monthly or annual statements showing what you've paid through the years. I have to review my own personal bank statements for the past 25 years to calculate my full payments. No other operating loan company doesn't provide this information. 

Below are the entire list of my complaints against Navient : Misleading borrowers about income-driven repayment plans : Navient failed to adequately notify borrowers who enrolled in income-driven repayment plans about the requirement to annually recertify their enrollment. Borrowers were not properly notified that submitting an incorrect or incomplete application to recertify their enrollment could lead to an increase in their monthly payments and delay loan cancellation. 

Botching payment processing : Many borrowers had multiple student loans with varying interest rates and monthly payments. When borrowers made payments meant to cover multiple loans, Navient misallocated payments. Navient also misapplied payments made to a particular loan. These errors resulted in late fees, interest accrual, and negative credit reporting. 

Harming the credit of XXXX borrowers, including severely injured veterans : Navient tarnished the credit reports of borrowers who had received a discharge on their federal student loans due to a total and permanent XXXX. 

Deceiving borrowers about XXXX requirements for cosigner release : Navient made representations to private loan borrowers that if they paid down their loans in a certain way, they could apply for their cosigners to be released. But Navient did not honor those representations for some borrowers. 

Misleading borrowers about improving credit scores and the consequences of federal student loan rehabilitation : For federal student loan borrowers whose loans went into default, XXXX debt collection arm promised credit reporting relief to borrowers if they completed a rehabilitation program.

Throughout my experience with Navient, I have encountered several issues that have led me to question the integrity of the practices employed by your organization. Specifically, I have received contradictory and misleading information regarding my loan terms, which has impeded my ability to manage my repayment effectively. 

Moreover, unexpected fees have been applied to my account without adequate explanation, further complicating my financial obligations. I was also informed that I could not release my co-signer from the loan, which contradicts prior communications I received suggesting that co-signer release options might be available. This misrepresentation has caused significant distress and confusion. 

Given these troubling experiences, I believe that the management of my loans has not adhered to the standards of transparency and ethical practice that borrowers deserve. As such, I am requesting a full discharge of my student loans serviced by Navient. 

I kindly ask for a prompt investigation into my account, a detailed response addressing my concerns, and information regarding the process for discharging my loans.

I attended the XXXX XXXX of XXXX between XXXX. The school closed down XX/XX/XXXX due to school misconduct. The enrollment process was rushed. I mis-informed about the financial aspect, the job opportunities and rate, company connections, and that XXXX be equipped to start my career as an advertiser. One of the biggest issues, is the private student loans. During XXXX, I wasnt informed there will be any federal funding issues covering my school expenses. Once I XXXX  and XXXX XXXX XXXX, everything was fine. After my semester, I was informed I didnt have enough federal loans so I should get a co signer or apply for private loans. I was unable to get a co-signer so they made it seem my only option was private loans. Details pertaining the private loans was not explained to me, wasnt discussed. I was just told I needed to apply to stay enrolled and to sign the documents. That process was also rushed. I was highly confused as to why I needed assistance from the private student loans when XXXX  didnt mention there wasnt enough government funding. Now that I am an adult and viewed my loans, and only XXXX private loans was requested. These private loans were dispersed from XXXX. 

Ive been struggling to make payments ever since. XXXX there was a recession and no one was hiring. Companies turned my portfolio and application down stating I didnt have the credentials or the experience. Some stated The XXXX XXXX XXXX  doesnt prepare you for success. 

XX/XX/XXXX, I lost my job and had a baby. I had no income at all. I called Navient ( private ) and explained my situation. I was informed by the agent, that there was nothing I can apply for. I ran out of forbearance XX/XX/XXXX and had to make payments. I informed her that I didnt have a flow of income and was living off savings trying to take care of my new born and I couldnt go to work due to XXXX. She informed me, that since Ive been paying all this time, that I can find the money from somewhere, that I am lying. If I dont pay, XXXX be sued. I have never been spoken too so rudely, in a dire situation, seeking assistance. I called them to file a complaint on the employee and was just informed they will take care of it but I had to still make the payments. 

Since then Ive made all the payments I could to sustain my credit and not being sued. My credit plummeted and my living situation was terrible. I worked hard to be re-employed and managed to bring up my credit score in hopes of a better life for myself and child. 

XX/XX/XXXX, I was informed I will have to pay over {$760.00} dollars monthly. I informed them, I dont have the funds to pay the high bill that I was already struggling and trying to find a way to get it lowered because my savings have been exhausted. I recently had to move and shelter expenses/childcare expenses are extremely expensive. Food has even quadrupled in price. 

I started searching and found that my school closed due to misconduct. I called and asked for the Misconduct form. I was first told it would be mailed to me. I waited and didnt receive it. I called back a 10 days later to check if its been mailed but it wasnt. I was able to get it after about request but had to log into the online portal, print it out, then mail it to them. I mailed the form in XX/XX/XXXX. I received a denial letter which didnt explain the reason for denial. It just stated I didnt meet the qualifications. I tried calling the number on the letter and couldnt reach no one. I was forwarded immediately to a voicemail message. I left several messages and no one contacted me back. 

The rates due the loans had increased to XXXX % and had me in a loop with no hopes of ever paying it with high demands of monthly payments. 

I called Navient and spoke to an agent who was not part of the misconduct team that handles the application and she stated to me that the misconduct had nothing to do with the private loans that its not suitable for being discharged. That I would have to lose my job but when I lost my job they didnt help me or state I could get my loans discharged. That I need to have proof that they personally did anything leading to predatory lending towards me, personally, dealing with the school. There were no options according to the agent. That was the whole point of putting in the school misconduct form, its one of their options listed on their application. Thats the purpose of it. 

I tried everything possible to pay them. I cant even file for bankruptcy because they are the reason for my hardship. They are refusing to discharge the loans no matter the situation. Even though I was falsely mislead. I dont have any proof because it was long ago and I lost everything after I graduated. I only had a suitcase with clothes. No prior emails work. I no longer have a student account. My XXXX account in which I was receiving school information was hacked into and unrecoverable. The school is closed and I cant get any information. There are no flyers or any information from that time. Just my testimony, as well as, all the other students testimony and lawsuits. I know I am not the only one. Some of them were able to provide evidence. 

The amount they are asking me to pay will leave me homeless once again. I am reaching out desperately seeking assistance. According to the agent, with my income, I am not eligible for hardship. Unfortunately, they do not factor in living expenses or childcare expenses. 

After all these years of making payments since XXXX, I owe {$67000.00} when I started off approximately {$42000.00} of private loans.

In XXXX the XXXX, the parent company of XXXX XXXX, was investigated and settled in a whistleblower suit for XXXX XXXX dollars to the tune of XXXX XXXX which is less than XXXX % of the original suit. They were found to be guilty of predatory recruitment and illegal recruiting practices across XXXX states and Washington, D.C., and numerous lawsuits alleging fraud. XXXX XXXX XXXX Part of those accusations included XXXX  XXXX XXXX. They were found to be lying about total costs, accreditation, and were also investigated for distorted program costs and job placement rates, and giving admission recruiters bonuses for getting more student to sign up. 

I experienced this in XXXX when signing up. The recruiter showed us costs, and the breakdown of how long it would take us to pay back the loans, with promises of a XXXX-year repayments, and a total tuition rate. I later found out all this was false, as my total after school was almost double the cost for the associates degree. In the late XXXX when trying to transfer to a local community college, I found no credits would transfer. I was stuck at this school. Some semesters I didnt know if Id be able to continue. We would get pink slips on the first day telling us we would be counted absent and asked to leave the campus unless we went down to request more financial aid. Why did I need more aid? Wasnt the amount I was told I needed the amount? They were getting us to sign up for more and more aid. Instead of having XXXX loan with an interest rate, I now have multiple Navient loans with high, variable rates, that Navient, XXXX and the XXXX would profit from. 

After finally leaving the campus, without graduating due to running out of funds and not being able to request more loans, career advisors also sent us XXXX job postings, or applications to XXXX so it would qualify as the print industry. There is a XXXX article outlining personal stories that sum up the average experience for students, and the lies we were told. XXXX of those students I attended XXXX with and we have very similar experiences. 

When leaving school, with no degree, I had {$60000.00} dollars in the original amount borrowed without compound interest. Now, over XXXX  years later of making full, on-time payments ranging from $ XXXX {$1100.00}, I am still sitting with {$65000.00} of loans. I have more than paid back my original loan amount. 

Which brings me to my next complaint. I also am XXXX of the students who were completely disregarded when Navient was sued by the CFPB for. Misallocated payments, steering struggling borrowers toward multiple forbearances instead of income-driven repayment plans, providing unclear information about how to re-enroll in income-driven repayment plans and how to qualify for a co-signer release. When this lawsuit happened, because I began making full, on-time payments and my loans we in good standing. I was left out of this suit. 

I was also lied to about repayment options and forced into multiple forbearances early in repayment by Navient, and was lied to about co-signer release. I have a previous CFPB complaint for this ( XXXX ). They should have record of this conversation where I called in to request the information for cosigner release and was lied to. I called to ask what was needed for me to release my co-signer was told I needed a credit check, proof of income, and I would need to make XXXX years of full, on-time payments to qualify for co-signer release. I then enrolled in auto-payments. AFTER making the XXXX  years of {$1100.00} payments, I was informed by Navient I could not have her released because I did not have a degree. Even though I met the qualifications I was initially told by their customer reps. I got a generic copy and paste response to my initial complaint and it was closed with no resolution. 

They also denied my ability to increase my monthly auto-draft to help re-pay these loans quicker. I was told I could not increase the amount or it would un-enroll me from the interest rate reduction program. I also filed a separate complaint about this, which was closed as a duplicate complaint but it was not ( XXXX ). I also have had issues with Navient refusing to send me paper statements. I have had to call multiple times to request they send them. I have recordings of these conversations. And now, they havent been sending them for XXXX years since the last time I reached out asking them to. I do this to protect myself from wrongly charged amounts and to watch them for illegal practices. 

Because of the numerous claims of fraud and misconduct perpetrated by these online for profit schools, such as XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX, I was able to file a XXXX XXXX claim with the Dept. of Education against XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX, and my Fed. loans of around {$42000.00} were discharged. My XXXX XXXX Claim was also part of the Sweet Vs. Cardona settlement for which I was a full class member. 

I am aware that Navient was sued by XXXX state AGs regarding their predatory loans to attend these online for-profit schools and that Sallie Mae/Navient were a "" preferred '' lending company in a "" deal '' with these schools during the early XXXX 's. These private loans with a high risk of default were part of a package deal offered to for profit schools. But loans made to students in states outside of the agreement, or those who were not in default for XXXX months or more during a "" specific '' time frame, were excluded. I am sure this was a big win for Navient, but what a sham of a settlement deal for the rest of borrowers scammed into taking loans to at least XXXX for profit online schools. 

After the AG settlement, didn't Navient also get out of the Federal student loan business due to scrutiny from lawmakers and borrower advocates? Didn't Navient have to pay restitution to the Federal student loan borrowers for not informing students of XXXX payments students could have enrolled in, but instead steered toward forbearance? Furthermore, hasn't Navient been sued at least a XXXX XXXX  times for other predatory loan practices and illegal collection practices? 

I am also aware of a "" pilot '' program by which Navient is sending out "" applications '' to select students who may have filed XXXX XXXX claims against their schools and were approved. This application is a sham. Why do we need to prove anything? Navient knows who we are. Under the FTC "" Holder Rule '' Navient is liable for giving predatory loans in connection with for-profit schools.

Upon touring the campus I met with a representiative who was moving very quickly in rattling off facts about student success rates, graduation job search advantages through the XXXX alumni network, how qualified the professors were etc. I am the first in my family to go to college and upon showing interest they immediately had me in the financial aid office getting me set up with pell grants and federal loans and then telling me that if awarded it still would not be enough so I would most likely need private loans as well. After learning that I was approved for federal loans and grants I took the information back to them and wanted to know what the balance to cover would be. They moved very fast and got me signed up for private loans to cover the balance and told me not to worry about the interest rates because those flucuate ( XXXX of my loans had a 14 % interest rate ). They signed hovered and insisted that in order to get into the fall semester that was coming up becuase the registration due date was approaching that I should do this now to esnure my placement in the school. For the next XXXX years each semester somehow there were balances between all of my loans and the tuition that would require additional private loans. Also, it should be noted, the professors and education provided was subpar at best. After 2 years of feeling like this campus was ripping me off and hearing that my credits would transfer to any accredited school, and absolutely would transfer to another XXXX campus, I made the decesion to look around for other schools. It was at this time that I realized they had lied as almost no other school with the program I was in would accept even half of my credits, so I was pigeonholed into finding another XXXX  campus to transfer to. 
In XXXX I moved to XXXXXXXX XXXX to help take care of some family members and chose this as there was an XXXX  campus in XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I met with the school and learned that several of my credits would not transfer and I would have to retake the courses... this of course requiring more money. Again I was brough into a financial aid/ advisors office and was being fed the lines of how successfull the students who graduate this particular campus are, how they are acredited in my field of study, how they have a robust alumni network etc. Then again, the same pressure to begin in the spring semester as "" we are running out of space '' was put on me and I found myself signed up again for more federal and private loans. During my time at this campus several professors had left, many students dropped out, and about XXXX before I was set to graduate was told that there was a balance descprepancy and I owed yet another XXXX but instead of applying for a loan I could just go on a payment plan right there at the campus through their office. I was a server at the time so I lived off from tips and shouldve known something was up when they accepted cash for any installment payment I made at the financial aid office. Upon graduating in spring of XXXX I was so burnt out and disheartend with my education through The XXXX XXXX that I chose to not attend and to have them just mail me my diploma ..... WHICH THEY NEVER DID, ONLY MY TRANSCRIPTS. I have been fighting with them ever since to get a copy of my diploma. 
After graduating my loans were serviced by XXXX XXXX, whos representatives worked with me to keep my payments on hold for as long as possible. After this period I had to start making payments and was quickly overwhelmed as now the reality of the interest rates that I was locked into was hitting me. My initial total in princepal loans had doubled in just my time at the school, and at the rates I was locked in at would continually balloon into something that would cause me to be homeless and every paycheck go to just paying interest alone. Once they sold the loans to XXXX, I was met with several representatives who said there was nothing I could do, there was no option to refinance, there was no income based repayment option that I could qualify for so the only option was to put the loans into forbearance .... And this was the cycle they pulled for months. 
After the lawsuite against XXXX established that they used predatory recruiting and lending tactics I knew that I was absolutely a victim of this and wanted retribution. I filed several application with the Borrowers Defense Fund, XXXX in XXXX, XXXX in XXXX, and XXXX again recently in XXXX after the lawsuit information was made public. My federal loans have been discharged and the XXXX campus and I belive all campus ' closed. I contacted XXXX for the application to have my private loans discharged as a result of the schools predatory methods and was told that "" our systems are down today, call back later so we can look into this '' and this happened several times with new excuses everytime ; "" we have an influx of applications and are only sending them out to people who qaulify '' "" Private student loans can not be discharged '' and now they have been sold off to a company by the name of Mohela that is telling me this is not an option no matter the lawuit or predatory methods the XXXX XXXX used while I was attending.",None,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",FL,33705,None,Consent provided,Web,11/21/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,10771930

Specifically, my payments have not been properly credited, leading to confusion about my outstanding balance. This has caused me to worry about potential late fees and impacts on my credit score. 

Customer Service Challenges : When I attempted to resolve these billing issues, I faced long wait times and unhelpful responses from customer service representatives. On multiple occasions, I was either misinformed or given contradictory information regarding my account status and payment options. 

Lack of Transparency : I have found it challenging to access clear information about my loan terms and repayment options. Despite my repeated requests for documentation, I have not received a satisfactory explanation of my loan details, which makes it difficult for me to manage my payments effectively. 

Payment Processing Delays : I have experienced delays in the processing of my payments, which has led to unnecessary stress and the potential for late fees. I expect timely processing, especially when payments are made on or before the due date.I believe I was steered into costly repayment options that have forced me to pay much more than they should have.i kindly request that you investigate these issues and issue a complain on my behalf to potential dissolve my current balance of {$51000.00}.

Over the years, I have experienced significant financial hardship due to capitalized interest, which led to my loan balance ballooning far beyond the original amount borrowed. Navients actions have included payment errors, mishandling of forbearance requests, and incorrect assessment of late fees. Furthermore, Navient has consistently misreported my payment status to credit agencies, which has caused severe damage to my credit score. Their representatives provided misleading information that prevented me from accessing better repayment options, leaving me with a growing and insurmountable debt. 

Additionally, I was unaware that by refinancing my loans with Earnest, I was still ultimately tied to Navient, which I feel was part of their deceptive tactics. These actions align with the widespread fraudulent behavior for which Navient has faced lawsuits from numerous states and investigations by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ). 

Navients conduct has inflicted financial harm, mental distress, and a burdensome debt that could have been avoided with transparent and fair treatment. As someone who trusted Navients guidance during an economically vulnerable period, I believe I deserve relief. I am therefore requesting the full forgiveness of my loans. 

Thank you for considering my request. I urge the CFPB to take prompt and decisive action to hold Navient accountable and provide meaningful relief to borrowers like myself.",None,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",VA,22202,None,Consent provided,Web,10/03/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,10319216

Because of the numerous claims of fraud and misconduct perpetrated by these online for profit schools, such as ( your school ), I was able to file a Borrower Defense claim with the Dept. of Education against ( your school ), and my Fed. loans of ( $ dollar amount ) were discharged and my credit repaired. 
My Borrower Defense Claim was also part of the XXXX XXXX XXXX  settlement for which I was a full class member. 
I am aware that Navient was sued by XXXX state AGs regarding their predatory loans to attend these online for-profit schools and that Sallie Mae/Navient were a "" preferred '' lending company in a "" deal '' with these schools during the early 2000 's. These private loans with a high risk of default were part of a package deal offered to "" for profit online schools ''. But loans made to students in states outside of the agreement, or those who were not in default for 7 months or more during a "" specific '' time frame, were excluded. I am sure this was a big win for Navient, but what a sham of a settlement deal for the rest of borrowers scammed into taking loans to at least XXXX for profit online schools. After the AG settlement, didn't Navient also get out of the Federal student loan business due to scrutiny from lawmakers and borrower advocates? Didn't Navient have to pay restitution to the Federal student loan borrowers for not informing students of IDR/IBR payments students could have enrolled in, but instead steered toward forbearance? Furthermore, hasn't Navient been sued at least a half dozen times for other predatory loan practices and illegal collection practices? 
I am also aware of a "" pilot '' program by which Navient is sending out "" applications '' to select students who may have filed Borrower Defense claims against their schools and were approved.

I've been hung up on while trying to explain my situation that I can't afford to make payments especially while unemployed. I've been told, oh well, when talking about how it seems unfair to be making payments for loans taken out by a school that no longer exists and is discredited and is facing multiple lawsuits. The amount of pressure put on me by the school made it seem like I had no other options. Navient is unwilling to listen to my concerns and gives me no other options and my payments just keep going up.

Before Navient took over servicing my loans, I was with Sallie Mae, both of which have been found guilty of predatory lending practices, particularly against minority households misled about the student loan process. As a XXXX individual, I believe I have experienced unfair treatment that has worsened my financial situation. 

The income-driven repayment system has not provided the relief it promised ; instead, it has added significant financial and emotional stress. 

Navients recent announcement regarding the transfer of student loan servicing to XXXX, framed as a standard business practice to reduce expenses, feels disingenuous. It disregards the years of profit made at the expense of students, and there has been a lack of acknowledgment or apology for the harm caused. 

Even with the settlement that has been agreed to, there will still be millions of affected people like myself who fear they will not be compensated fairly and accurately. 

I urge your company to review my case and address these concerns promptly. It is essential for companies in this sector to ensure fair treatment of all borrowers, regardless of background. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.

10/01/24,Student loan,Private student loan,Struggling to repay your loan,Problem lowering your monthly payments,"To Whom It May Concern, I'm writing to file a formal complaint against Navient for unfair practices related to my private student loan, which stems from a fraudulent for-profit school, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX that I attended over XXXX years ago. The institution promised an XXXX XXXX program during admissions ( claiming that I will be grandfathered into the XXXX XXXX program once the school became an associate program through the duration of my time enrolled ) but instead engaged in deceptive practices, ultimately convincing me into taking a second private loan to cover the remaining XXXX months of the program I had left, without informing me that I had to renew my eligibility for financial aid to potentially cover the remaining few months of the program that was left. At XXXX, I was unaware that financial aid had to be renewed every year. The program was an XXXX month program. 

At the time, I did not understand the loan terms or the implications of the agreements I was coerced into signing. I was not offered financial aid or the opportunity to reapply for it, which I know now would have been an option. The school 's fraudulent activities have since come to light, resulting in numerous lawsuits, and yet, Navient continues to profit for this predatory loan. 

Upon completion of the program at XXXX XXXX, I became a mother. I reached out to XXXXNavient for assistance with loan repayment, but was offered forbearance, which led to escalating interest rates. This resulted in a debt cycle that has now spanned nearly XXXX decades, making it clear that I would be paying off this loan indefinitely. Only after I exhausted all forbearance and deferment options was, I offered an interest only repayment plan that aligned more with my income. 

Currently, my loan has re-entered repayment following the completion of a program at a local community college. When I sought further assistance from Navient today, XX/XX/year>, I was offered repayment programs with a higher interest rate with a monthly payment that exceeded what is currently showing on monthly statement. This does not make financial sense and is not sustainable circumstances. 

As a mother of XXXX special needs children - one who is non-verbal and another with an intellectual XXXX- I am often required to take leave and change jobs frequently. Despite explaining my situation to Navient, the only options presented are programs that increase my financial burden, making repayment impossible. 

I request an investigation into Navient 's practices regarding my loan, as they are unfair, predatory and unsustainable. Navient 's continued collection efforts on a loan originating from a fraudulent institution, particularly given the settlements and proven predatory practices, are unacceptable.

2. Regulatory Violations : I am aware of Navients history of violations of various financial laws, which have resulted in significant penalties from regulatory bodies.

10/03/24,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"I am writing to formally request a complete and total discharge of all of my student loans held by Navient because of their misleading and misguided practices as well as their misrepresentation and their failure to provide correct and proper information and guidance pertaining to my student loan repayment options. 

Navient misguided me into choosing forbearance and deferment options, year after year after year, instead of guiding me toward income driven repayment plans that would have allowed me to obtain more affordable payments that would have eventually led me to student loan forgiveness. With the steering away from the income driven repayment options, my loan amounts continuously increased to amounts that surpassed the original amount of the loan. These incidents caused my credit score to repeatedly plummet and cause a financial strain which has made it difficult for me to obtain my expected financial obligations. 

Also, Navient has a sorted history of misreporting my payment status to the necessary credit agencies which overwhelmingly damaged my credit score. The inaccurate information provided by their representatives has interfered with my ability to obtain a more fair and equitable repayment options which has contributed to an astounding amount of accrued debt. These unfair and unscrupulous practices are consistent with the company 's boundless fraudulent actions for which Navient has been sued by many states and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ). 

Navient 's practices have caused me a great deal of financial harm, undue stress, anxiety and a lasting financial burden which could have been avoided with fair guidance concerning my student loan repayment options. I trusted the agents that I spoke with on numerous occasions to help guide me in the best decisions regarding my student loan repayments. This unfair practice has created an unnecessary and unjust financial burden and I would ask to have all of my student loans fully forgiven. 

Thank you for reviewing my request. I am hoping that CFPB will take the steps and actions to hold Navient accountable for their unfair practices and provided complete student loan forgiveness.",None,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",OH,43607,None,Consent provided,Web,10/03/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,10318092

01/23/24,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"I really could use some assistance with having Navient correct the 2 major ongoing issues I am having with my 3 private student loans serviced by them, dating back to the time when Navient and SallieMae were one company. I have brought this to their attention numerous times with no resolution, starting with the first call I had with their supervisor, XXXX, on XX/XX/XXXX. She sent my case to the customer advocate team. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from Navient dated XX/XX/XXXX. This contained a Declining Balance letter and account history for all private student loans. This history contains the following statement on the bottom of every page : This financial history removes offsetting transaction on your account that do not impact your loan balance. This is to avoid confusion with administrative adjustments processed on your account. I have compared this data to the information available to me when logged into my account on XXXX. I printed the account history for all 3 of my private student loans, along with downloading the CSV file. I have attached scans of these printouts, including my mark-ups, for your reference. When comparing the printout to the declining balance history letter received on XX/XX/XXXX with the account histories printed on XX/XX/XXXX, you will be able to see 3 key differences across all 3 loans. The first is that the Declining Balance letter shows a starting principal balance that matches the amount disbursed on the day it was disbursed. On the scanned printouts, the unpaid principal balance shows an amount considerably higher than what was disbursed. The second is that the XXXX Resale transaction on the account history printout has been omitted in the declining balance history across all 3 loans. The amount of the Resale transaction is the exact difference between the amount disbursed and the unpaid principal balance amount on the day of disbursement. Because interest on a loan is calculated using the unpaid principal balance, and the unpaid principal balance was higher than owed since the date of disbursement, the total amount of interest calculated and either paid or capitalized for the life of the loan is considerably higher than was supposed to be calculated. I also believe that Navient is fully aware of this error and is trying to hide it due to the Resale transactions being omitted. They have since then removed this transaction from my XXXX account history and changed the starting principal balance to match the actual amount disbursed. This is all outlined in detail below. The third key difference is the fact that the Late Fee Reversal transaction was omitted in the Declining Balance History Letter. As you can see by the scanned printouts, on XX/XX/XXXX all late fees currently owed were reversed, rendering them no longer owed. Over the past 10 years, Navient has allocated portions of my payments to pay for late fees that are not owed. 

Since receiving this on XX/XX/XXXX, I have spoken to numerous customer service representatives and supervisors. They have created numerous tickets for the customer advocate department. Each time, informing me that Navient has done nothing wrong, then harassing me with multiple daily phone calls from different phone numbers. On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent an email to XXXX XXXX. According to an email I received from her on XX/XX/XXXX, she works in the customer advocate department. She had emailed me an updated copy of the Declining Balance letter, along with copies of my loan applications and other terms of the loans. In response, I attached documented evidence printed from my portal on XXXX clearly showing the errors on my account. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email acknowledging receipt of it. Since then, there has been no resolution to these issues. On the XXXX of each month I am faced with a choice to pay a minimum amount to keep negative credit reporting from being reported to the 3 credit bureaus, or cause damage to my credit rating. It is not fair or ethical for a company to continue to put their customer in that position and ignore the evidence that has been presented to them. 

Details for Issue 1 : The first issue dates back to the date of disbursement for each of the Private Student Loans I have serviced with them. From day 1, they had the incorrect unpaid principal balance in place, directly impacting the amount of interest that was calculated and then either paid or capitalized and added to the principal balance. This issue went on throughout the life of all 3 of my private student loans. On XXXX XXXX XXXX, Navient acquired my loans from SallieMae. On this date, the difference between the actual amount disbursed and the incorrect principal balance on date of disbursement was credited to the current outstanding principal balance. This is notated with the description Resale on each of them. What they had failed to do was credit the amount of extra interest calculated for the time period between disbursement and XX/XX/XXXX. Please see below detailing all this out : Per Declining Balance Letter Received XXXX and XXXX printout dated XX/XX/XXXX : The first loan ( XXXX ) was disbursed on XX/XX/XXXX for the amount of {$4600.00}, The second loan ( XXXX ) was disbursed on XX/XX/XXXX for the amount of {$4800.00} The third loan ( XXXX ) was disbursed on XXXX XXXX XXXX for the amount of {$1800.00} Total Actual Amount of Private Student Loans disbursed : {$11000.00} Per XXXX printout dated XX/XX/XXXX : On the date of Disbursement, SallieMae ( Navient ) notated that the unpaid principal balance owed was the following : XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX ) Unpaid Principal Balance Per Navient/SallieMae : {$9300.00} XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) Unpaid Principal Balance Per Navient/SallieMae : {$7700.00} XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX ) Unpaid Principal Balance Per Navient/SallieMae : {$4000.00} Total Unpaid Principal Balance of Private Student Loans per Navient/SallieMae : {$21000.00} The total actual amount owed after school refunds, prior to interest being capitalized on XX/XX/XXXX : {$6400.00} Total Principal Balance per Navient.com printout dated XX/XX/XXXX after School Refunds, prior to interest being capitalized on XX/XX/XXXX : {$16000.00} The difference between the actual amount owed and unpaid principal balance documented per Navient.com printout dated XX/XX/XXXX is {$9800.00}. This amount is 46.7 % higher than the actual amount owed at the time of disbursement and 60.5 % higher than the actual amount owed after School Refunds were credited to the principal balance. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, interest during the time period between disbursement and that date, was capitalized. The issue is that SallieMae ( Navient ) calculated the interest on the wrong principal balances. This information can be referenced using the XXXX loan history Printouts Dated XX/XX/XXXX and Interest Rate Calculated Using Incorrect Unpaid Principal Balance Comparison PDF files created from the downloaded CSV files from XXXX. Please see below detailing this out : Loan XXXX : Because the Principal Balance per XXXX and downloaded CSV file from XXXX was {$9300.00} on day of disbursement, {$8700.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, {$7700.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, and {$7600.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, the interest that was capitalized on XX/XX/XXXX was {$1200.00}. Based on those facts provided by Navient.com that would make the average interest rate that I was paying during that timeframe 5.888 %, calculated on a daily basis. 
Using the 5.888 % interest rate calculated daily, using the correct Principal Balance, the total interest, that should have been capitalized would have been {$530.00}. This is a difference of {$750.00} in extra interest being capitalized and added to principal. 

Loan XXXX : Because the Principal Balance per Navient.com and downloaded CSV file from Navient.com was {$7700.00} on the day of disbursement, {$6600.00} on XXXX XXXX XXXX, {$5400.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, and {$4500.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, the interest that was capitalized on XX/XX/XXXX was {$710.00}. Based on those facts provided by XXXX, that would make the average interest rate that I was paying 6.455 %, calculated on a daily basis. 
Using the 6.455 % interest rate, calculated daily using the correct Principal Balance, the total interest that should have been capitalized would have been {$330.00}. This is a difference of {$370.00} in extra interest being capitalized and added to principal. 

Loan XXXX : Because the Principal Balance per XXXX and downloaded CSV file from XXXX was {$4000.00} on the day of disbursement, the interest that was capitalized on XX/XX/XXXX was {$170.00}. Based on those facts provided by XXXX, that would make the average interest rate that I was paying 6.810 %, calculated on a daily basis. 
Using the 6.810 % interest rate, calculated daily using the correct Principal Balance, the total interest that should have been capitalized would have been {$80.00}. This is a difference of {$97.00} in extra interest being capitalized and added to principal. 

Based on the above facts and calculations, the total amount of extra interest calculated and capitalized across all 3 private student loans on XX/XX/XXXX was {$1200.00}. This means that on XX/XX/XXXX the total principal balance that SallieMae ( Navient ) had calculated interest on was {$18000.00}. The breakdown for each loan from Navient.com is below. This can be viewed on the Navient.com scanned printout dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 

XXXX : {$8900.00} XXXX : {$5200.00} XXXX : {$4200.00} Based on that, on XX/XX/XXXX the principal balance that interest was calculated on was off by {$11000.00}. This is outlined below : XXXX : {$5400.00} ( {$4700.00} Error in principal on disbursement date, plus {$750.00} in extra interest ) XXXX : {$3200.00} ( {$2900.00} Error in principal on disbursement date, plus {$370.00} in extra interest ) XXXX : {$2300.00} ( {$2200.00} Error in principal on disbursement date, plus {$97.00} in extra interest ) This practice of SallieMae ( Navient ) calculating interest on the wrong principal balance owed went on throughout the entire life of all 3 private student loans. This was partly corrected on XX/XX/XXXX. This was the date that Navient took over the loans from SallieMae. On that date, the difference between the actual disbursement and the principal balance keyed in on the date of disbursement was credited back to the principal balance. This is shown on the XXXX printout of my loan history dated XX/XX/XXXX and the Interest Rate Calculated Using Incorrect Unpaid Principal Balance Comparison PDF Files created from the CSV downloads from XXXX. However, they failed to credit back the extra interest calculated and either paid or capitalized using the wrong principal balance. This includes payments that should have been applied to principal when there should have been no interest balance due. All the details and calculations are inside of the attachments provided for each private student loan. 

By the time Navient took over the loan on XXXX XXXX XXXX the total principal balance across all 3 Private Student Loans was off by {$3800.00}. This can be referenced using the Interest Rate Calculated Using Incorrect Unpaid Principal Balance Comparison PDF files created from the downloaded CSV files from Navient.com. The breakdown of this is below. 

XXXX : {$2100.00} XXXX : {$1000.00} XXXX : {$650.00} Details for Issue 2 : The second issue starts at the point where Navient had taken over the loans from SallieMae. On XX/XX/XXXX, any and all late fees that were owed at that time were then reversed and no longer owed. This is shown as Late Fee Reversal on all 3 of my private student loans. This is on the scanned printout from XXXX dated XXXX along with the CSV download from XXXX. After this date, Navient applied payments on all 3 loans towards late fees that had been reversed. This directly impacted the principal balance owed because the payment made, was not applied to the principal balance, but to late fees that were at a zero balance. Interest was then calculated on a higher balance caused, not only by calculating interest on a wrong principal balance since the date of disbursement, but also by applying payments towards late fees, when they should have been going to principal. This can all be referenced in the Unowed Late Fees Paid and Extra Interest Paid Due to Misallocation of Payments PDF Files and the Scanned printout from Navient.com dated XXXX 

In addition to the noted above files, I have also attached a word document containing video links of me accessing my XXXX portal.

01/22/24,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"XX/XX/XXXX Subject : Complaint and Urgent Request for Compliance Dear Navient, I hope this communication finds you in good health. I am writing to you regarding some substantial concerns I have uncovered during my thorough examination of the operations of Navient. As a conscientious consumer and advocate for ethical business practices, I believe it is crucial to bring these matters to your attention for immediate investigation and resolution. 
1. Opting Out Violation ( 15 USC 6802-6805 ) : Upon reviewing the legal framework provided by 15 USC 6802-6805 , which empowers consumers to opt out of financial information sharing with institutions, I have observed potential instances where Navient might not be fully adhering to these statutory provisions. This has raised concerns about the protection of consumer privacy rights. It is my earnest request that your team conducts a comprehensive review and takes necessary steps to rectify any non-compliance issues promptly. 
2. Credit Report Accuracy Infringement ( 15 USC 1681 ) : In the course of scrutinizing my credit report obtained from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX I have uncover discrepancies that may be in violation of 15 USC 1681. This crucial federal law mandates the accuracy and fairness of credit reporting, placing a responsibility on entities like Navient to conduct thorough investigations and promptly rectify any inaccuracies. Ensuring compliance with this law is vital for maintaining consumer trust and confidence. 
3. CFPB Complaints Negligence : My investigation has brought to light a potential neglect in addressing and resolving complaints submitted to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ). Failure to actively engage with and resolve these complaints is a direct violation of CFPB regulations. I urge Navient to conduct an in-depth internal review, recognizing and rectifying any shortcomings in addressing outstanding complaints. This proactive approach is not only essential for regulatory compliance but also crucial for upholding the reputation of your organization. 
4. Privacy Act of 1974 Non-Compliance ( 5 U.S.C. 552a ) : Preliminary findings suggest a potential non-compliance with the Privacy Act of 1974 ( 5 U.S.C. 552a ). This federal legislation mandates precise management of personal information by government entities. Any deviation from its stipulations requires immediate attention. I strongly recommend that Navient initiates an immediate internal audit to ensure strict adherence to the Privacy Act. Proactive steps in this regard will not only align the organization with legal mandates but also enhance overall data protection measures. 
5. General Redress and Compensation ( 15 U.S.C. 1681n ) : The collective impact of these infringements has resulted in both quantifiable and intangible harm. In accordance with 15 U.S.C. 1681n, I formally demand Navient to provide due compensation for the distress and material losses borne as a direct consequence of these transgressions. This includes but is not limited to the time and effort expended in rectifying inaccuracies, emotional distress, and any financial repercussions suffered. 
To facilitate a fair and swift resolution, I kindly request a comprehensive response addressing each of the highlighted concerns within [ 30 days ]. I believe that your immediate attention to these matters will not only lead to a swift resolution but also uphold the integrity of legal mandates and safeguard the rights and interests of consumers.

11/30/24,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Keep getting calls about your loan,"I took private student loans from Navient from XXXX. I was not working and did not have good credit at the time so my mother co-signed the loans for me. Once I graduated, I put forth best efforts to repay the loan. However, I had severe financial struggles and needed multiple forbearances. I lost my mother in XXXX and was told that I was no longer eligible for forbearances because I maxed out. When I explained to them that my mother died and I was experiencing health issues, they told me that I had to make a payment or I'd default, I started paying them with credit cards to prevent default. In XXXX, I applied for and was granted XXXX  XXXX bankruptcy but my attorney refused to argue for student loan forgiveness in the separate hearing. I could not afford another attorney to handle the special hearing for student loans. Navient did not acknowledge my mother 's death until XXXX when I received a letter from them saying they recently learned of her death although I'd been telling them for years. My struggles with Navient lasted from XXXX  through XXXX when I could no longer afford my payments and refused to pay interest only. My total loan balances ballooned from the initial {$14000.00} to over {$41000.00}. I spoke to multiple representatives during this time about their predatory lending practices and offered to pay the amount I borrowed if they would remove all of the years of interest they had tacked on. I argued that even when I made payments, my balances continued to increase. They offered to settle for 60 % of the balance, to be paid in three installments. The amount was unfair and I explained that I did not have that type of money to pay them. I stopped taking their calls and Navient then started calling people associated with my and disclosing the matter to them, violating my privacy. They left a detailed voicemail on my sister 's phone. They called my husband and disclosed the matter to him, and I was not married when these loans were taken. He was not aware of the matter. The also left messages on my son 's phone. They started reaching out to past employers as well. During this time, they threatened me with legal action. Finally, when trying to embarrass me did not work, and threatening legal action did not work, they sold me loan to a debt collector. I feel I have made enough payments over the years that my loan should have been considered settled or even written off. Not sent to a collection agency to further harm my credit, after multiple offers from myself to try to resolve the matter. Their practices are illegal and unjust.

The breaking point came when Navient finally acknowledged that the portal they directed me to was defunct and unmonitored. The toll on my mental health was devastating. Enduring tearful phone calls and falling into a XXXX  XXXX and associated weight gain which my family and close friends can attest to.

In XXXX, a XXXX XXXX Representative talked me into consolidating XXXX loans ( 1 XXXX, 12 XXXX loans, and 8 XXXX loans ) into one loan under the pretense that my loan payment would be lower. 

However, the interest rate of the consolidated loan was over 9 % and has remained between 8 % -9 % for over 22 years. 

Additionally, I received a {$20000.00} Student Loan repayment bonus from the U.S. Army that was applied to the loan. Over the years, despite how many payments I have made, the consolidated loan total has not changed because of the absorbent interest rate that kept me in the same place. 

I contacted Navient many times requesting to be added to the income-driven repayment but was selected for a forbearance instead. Also, I believe my payments were mismanaged, especially since the Army paid {$20000.00} towards my loan and my balance is still over {$16000.00}. 

I would like to request that my loan be considered for discharge. I am a U.S. Army XXXX ( Service Connected ) Veteran and I believe some of my paperwork was lost in the process of the consolidation. I believe XXXX also mismanaged my loan ; however I submitted a CFBP Borrower Defense Claim ( # XXXX ) in XX/XX/XXXX, and it was denied.

02/27/24,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"In XXXX Navient reached a settlement with many states Attorney Generals to cancel over a XXXX dollars in private student loans. However, my private student loans with Navient weren't included on the list of those that were being forgiven. Instead, my student loans were charged off in XX/XX/XXXX without my knowledge. I wasn't sent a letter of warning or final action etc. I thought that my loans were in Forbearance like other federal and private loans. I contacted Navient in XXXX to start a repayment program. I was misled into believing that if I make XXXX payments the rest of my balance would be forgiven. This so-called agreement was not in writing, just over the phone. I took a chance that the representative was telling the truth. I made a payment in XXXX after asking for and being denied over the phone, for a forbearance, deferment, or XXXX related forgiveness. I currently have many ongoing XXXX issues and was contemplating on retiring early under a XXXX retirement. I asked for applications to each program, I couldn't find any applications online, and was told that they would be mailed to me. They never were. I contacted Navient in late XXXX, early XXXX, to learn more about the program only to find out that the program was not a forgiveness program. I informed that I never receive any applications in the mail and that I would need more information before any more payment would be made. I became sicker and was focusing more on my health than Navient 's lack of communication. I ended up in the hospital for over a week then back in the hospital a week later. I didn't know that Navient closed my student loans until I applied for a line of credit. I was just informed this month that I had been charged off 6 months ago. 

Navient failed to send me any notification for years about my student loans. They did not send any statements to me although I would update my address online. I set up auto bill payments and established first contact with the service. I even set up my email to receive statements or communication from the service. On XX/XX/XXXX, after the charge off, I received an email stating that they were updated my address after I contacted them to again ask for a deferment. I was not informed while talking to the representative that my loans were charged off. 

Navient failed me notify me of any action they took. Navient did everything they could to make sure I would fail at paying off my student loans.",None,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",PA,19020,None,Consent provided,Web,02/27/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,8433562

09/20/24,Student loan,Private student loan,Struggling to repay your loan,Can't get other flexible options for repaying your loan,"XX/XX/year> To Whom It May Concern : I, XXXX XXXX, am submitting a formal complaint against Navient, a student loan servicer, for their failure to provide adequate service and for engaging in practices that have caused significant financial harm to me as a borrower. Below are the specific details of my complaint : 1. Misleading and Confusing Information Regarding Repayment Options Navient has consistently provided me with incorrect, incomplete, or misleading information regarding my repayment options. When I initially sought guidance on available repayment plans, particularly income-driven repayment ( IDR ) plans, I was not informed of all available options. Navient representatives provided incomplete details, failing to explain key aspects of these plans, including eligibility criteria, payment calculations, and how to apply for forgiveness programs under these plans. 

In addition, when I requested information on consolidating my loans and entering a new repayment plan, the guidance I received was both inconsistent and contradictory, causing further confusion. As a result, I was unable to make informed decisions, leading to missed opportunities to lower my monthly payments and ultimately increasing my total loan burden.

2. Failure to Properly Apply Payments Over the course of several months, I have experienced numerous instances where Navient failed to properly apply payments to my account. Despite submitting timely payments, these payments were either applied to the wrong loan or not credited to my account at all, causing my account to reflect inaccurate balances. I was subsequently charged late fees and accrued additional interest due to Navient 's misapplication of my payments. 

Despite multiple calls to their customer service department to resolve these issues, the problem persists, and I have not been given a clear explanation for why payments are not being applied correctly. This has caused severe financial distress, as I am now facing a higher loan balance and additional fees that should not have been assessed.

3. Failure to Provide Accurate Information on Loan Forgiveness Programs I am also extremely dissatisfied with Navient 's handling of loan forgiveness programs. I have contacted Navient on numerous occasions to inquire about my eligibility for Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) and other forgiveness options, as I have been working in a qualifying public service position for several years. However, Navient failed to provide accurate information regarding the specific requirements of the PSLF program and did not properly track my qualifying payments toward forgiveness.

As a result of this failure, I am not receiving credit for all the payments I have made while employed in a public service position. This has caused significant delays in my progress toward loan forgiveness, unfairly extending the time I must continue making payments on my loans.

4. Steering Into Forbearance Instead of Income-Driven Repayment Plans When I reached out to Navient to discuss options for lowering my payments during periods of financial hardship, I was steered into forbearance instead of being properly informed about income-driven repayment plans, which would have been a better solution for my financial situation. As a result, my loan balance increased due to the accumulation of interest during the periods of forbearance, which was not clearly explained to me at the time. This has further increased my financial burden and delayed my progress toward eventual loan forgiveness.

5. Poor Customer Service and Lack of Accountability The level of customer service provided by Navient has been consistently poor. Representatives frequently provide conflicting information, fail to follow up on issues, and seem ill-equipped to handle even basic inquiries about loan repayment and servicing. I have been forced to spend hours on the phone trying to resolve issues that should have been addressed promptly, and my requests for escalation to higher levels of management have often been ignored or dismissed.

In addition to these systemic issues, Navient has shown a lack of accountability when addressing the errors they have caused in my account. I have not received satisfactory explanations or resolutions for the misapplied payments, inaccurate balance calculations, and improper guidance regarding repayment options and loan forgiveness.

Conclusion and Desired Resolution Navient 's actionsor lack thereofhave caused significant financial harm and emotional distress. As a student loan borrower, I relied on Navient to provide accurate and timely information about my loans and repayment options, yet they have consistently failed to do so. I am seeking the following resolutions : 1. A thorough review of my loan account to ensure that all payments are properly applied and credited, with any incorrect charges, late fees, or accrued interest removed from my account.

2. An accurate reassessment of my eligibility and progress toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) and other loan forgiveness programs, with appropriate credit given for all qualifying payments made to date.

3. Reimbursement for any fees and interest accrued as a result of Navient 's failure to provide accurate information about income-driven repayment plans and their improper steering into forbearance.

4. A formal explanation from Navient acknowledging their errors and detailing corrective actions taken to prevent these issues from recurring.

5. Compensation for the financial harm and emotional distress caused by Navient 's failure to provide competent and reliable service.

I trust that the CFPB will take my complaint seriously and investigate Navient 's practices thoroughly. Navient 's behavior has not only impacted my financial well-being but has also caused widespread harm to countless other borrowers who rely on them for accurate loan servicing.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I look forward to a resolution that addresses the issues outlined above and prevents further harm to other borrowers.

09/17/24,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"I am disputing the 90 days late Navient reported on all XXXX of my loans to the credit bureaus. This is an error due to the 'auto pay on Their website not working properly, the lack of information on their website regarding 'auto pay ' and the misinformation / lack of information on their website regarding 'the student loan payment pause '. And I am requesting that they reverse/ remove the negative report to the credit bureau that my XXXX loans with Navient were 90 days late. 
AUTO PAY NOT WORKING PROPERLY- each time I tried to sign up for auto pay, the message would tell me my payment will start being deducted from my bank account the next month but when the next month came, my payment did not get deducted so I paid manually and then I tried the auto pay again. The same thing happened the next month, so I manually paid again thinking that maybe there was just a glitch and that it would be working properly the following month. 
PAYMENT PAUSE - Because I thought I was on the student loan payment pause I thought I was just making extra payments to try to stay ahead so after the XXXX attempt at auto pay I thought everything was working correctly now ( XX/XX/XXXX ). 
After a few months ( XX/XX/XXXX ), I received an alert on my credit report that I was 90 days late with all XXXX of the loans that Navient service. I immediately called the Navient representative to see how this could happen when I'm on auto pay along with being on the student loan payment pause, so how can I be 90 days late on my loans. I was shockingly informed that "" only certain loans qualified for 'the student loan payment pause ' and that mine did not ''. Nowhere on their website states that the loans Navient service don't qualify for the student loan payment pause. I was then informed from the Navient representative that "" since my loan payment is due on the XXXX of each month, I would have to sign up for auto pay after my payment is due but no later than XXXX  days before the next due date '', it does not tell you how to properly set up auto pay on Their website so that's why it wasn't accepting my auto pay but I didn't find this out until the damage was already done. The representative then told me that I could file a dispute with Navient and if they found that their was any error on their part they would reverse/ remove the XXXX  days late on all XXXX of the loans from my credit report. so I filled a dispute with Navient and they said that their was no error on their part and they would not remove or reverse the XXXX  days late on all XXXX of the loans off my credit report. I couldn't believe it for the simple fact that when you sign up for autopay it doesn't tell you to sign up after your due date but no longer than XXXX  days before the next due date, that right there is an ERROR on there part. not to mention no where on their website states that the loans they service do not qualify for the student loan payment pause. 
There's no way possible that I would have let my loans go unpaid for XXXX  days, not even XXXX  day. I've always pay my bills on time. From the lack of information / misinformation on their website my XXXX XXXX dropped around XXXX points Causing me major hardships in my life. it's hard enough out here without XXXX dollar companies misleading and praying on every day working class people just trying to make a living and provide for their families. 
PS I'm sure they're making lots of money in late fees from the lack of information on their website regarding how to properly sign up for autopay and the loans they service not being eligible for the student loan payment pause. 
Navient needs to remove the XXXX  days late on my credit report. and they need to have proper instructions on enrolling in auto pay and they failed to inform borrowers on their website that their loans weren't eligible for the student loan payment pause.",None,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",CA,94533,None,Consent provided,Web,09/17/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,10156636

I have never defaulted on a loan, it is my highest priority to ensure that my loans are paid each month since I graduated in 2008. They have offered no flexibility at all. They have put me through interest only payments and forbearance in the past, which has significantly increased my overall amount on already inflated loans. They allowed for me, as a young person, to take loans with no cosigner, not understanding the impact, yet I have been taking responsibility for my commitment. I have been enrolled in a 6 month rate reduction program several times, and currently am. But I am going back and seeing documentation where they actually put a bulk of my loans in forbearance, which I DID NOT agree to. Also, when I called six months ago to reenroll in rate reduction, they told me what my "" reduced '' payment would be, which was more than my original payment anyway. When I ask for documentation or notification of why they just say things like the government controls the rates. I NEVER receive paper mail for then regarding ANYTHING on my account. The ONLY communication I get is an email stating when my monthly auto pay is coming out, they love to only communicate when it is about the money you are giving them. For years and years I have just taken it and given them my money, at the mercy of whenever they want to change the rules. They never provide the documentation requested. I just scheduled an auto pay TODAY and they wouldn't even provide documentation show the change of date for my account. They rarely provide documents, even when asked, and the agents are trained customer service reps, they are not qualified or versed in explaining details, it just doesn't happen. I don't know what else to do or where to go for help. I ALWAYS ensure this bill is paid, yet they WONT work with me and have signed me up for things like a forbearance without my permission and stating I was being placed in rate reduction. It is all so confusing to begin with, but they keep doing things on the account that are making my financial wellness worse off. Now I am being told my loans are going to another servicer and I have no choice in the matter.

01/30/24,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Keep getting calls about your loan,"Have been unemployed since XXXX ; Navient has been bombarding me with automated spam calls, demanding payments on my private student loans ; at least once a day, up to 6-8 times. Speaking to representatives I have been told that there are no options to stop these calls and the best they can do is "" push them back '' for "" a couple of days ''. I do not answer my phone anymore ; seldom do they leave a voicemail message or identify themselves in any way. 

When they do leave a message it's a demand that I contact them by phone - they will not communicate Private Loans forbearances or repayment plans via email ; which can only be sent to them via the Navient website ; no records of emails I have sent to them are made available to me- I have to keep a record of them myself if I want to see more than a fragment of it in the correspondence posted. 

When I stopped responding to phone calls, they began calling and sending letters to my cosigners. In XX/XX/XXXX my mother paid the past-due balance after a letter threatening "" Review for Litigation '' arrived the XXXX- with only four days before the stated deadline of XX/XX/XXXX despite being dated XX/XX/XXXX. Seeing the postmark on the envelope indicates it was shipped on the XXXX, I have reason to believe this letter was purposely dated/postmarked in such a way to arrive "" late '' as an intimidation tactic. 

Navient has also refused to discharge the loans under the Attorneys General settlement where they were found to be using abusive and deceptive practices including pushing forbearances on cases of financial hardship rather than more viable options, so as to extend the loans further ; my case was refused on the grounds that my loans had "" never been in default, '' and so weren't eligible - ignoring that the school I attended with those loans was also found to be engaging in deceptive/abusive practices, and that my loans never defaulted because I had taken forbearances on Navient 's advice. My attempts to communicate this with them were refused and ignored. 

I have repeatedly stated that I have no stable income and am unable to make payments in the amounts demanded, making this harassment - they have ignored this and continued spamming my phone with calls and sending threats of litigation, knowing full well that I'm struggling with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and that my financial situation has not changed ; I have been informed I am no longer eligible for no-payment hardship forbearance on this loan and I have repeatedly asked for my payments to be lowered and late fees waived - which have all been refused. Navient refuses to negotiate payment in any way or allow any sort of relief without some manner of payment ; Speaking to "" XXXX XXXX '' over the phone tonight I was told they weren't even going to bother offering any repayment/relief options as I had stated before that I was unable to make any kind of payment at this time. 

Another letter threatening "" Review for Litigation '' arrived XX/XX/XXXX, dated the XXXX and demanding a "" satisfactory agreement to resolve your account by XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX'.

As a XXXX XXXX, these practices have also jeopardized my ability to maintain my security clearance, directly affecting my career And duty. 

1. Harassment and Coercive Practices : Navient has persistently made harassing phone calls demanding payment, despite my clear financial constraints. Their representatives have advised me to reduce my basic living expenses and even suggested that I borrow money from relatives to meet loan payments, showcasing a lack of consideration and ethical lending practices. 
2. Unreasonable Settlement Offers : On multiple occasions, Navient has pressured me to accept settlement offers that were not financially feasible. They presented these offers as once-in-a-lifetime opportunities, using high-pressure tactics to coerce acceptance. 
3. Invasion of Privacy : Navient has overstepped boundaries by contacting my family members without my consent, seeking personal information and payment towards my student loans. This not only breaches privacy norms but also places undue stress on my family relationships. 
4. Educational Institution Misconduct : I attended the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX from XXXX to XXXX, a school that has since been closed due to predatory and illegal practices. The loans for this institution, initially serviced by Sallie Mae and later by Navient, have been a source of continual struggle due to the deceptive circumstances under which they were promoted and agreed upon. 
5. Discharge Under BDTR : My federal loans have been discharged under the Borrower Defense to Repayment ( BDTR ) due to the recognized misconduct of my educational institution. However, the ongoing issues with Navient, including their handling of my remaining loans and their aggressive collection practices, continue to cause significant personal distress and financial instability. 

These actions by Navient represent a blatant disregard for borrower rights and protections that are expected from a federal loan servicer. Managing these loans under such aggressive and unethical tactics has not only financial implications but also potential long-term effects on my career in the military. 

I urge the CFPB to investigate these practices and to hold Navient accountable for their actions that are contrary to the principles of fair and ethical lending.

Navient is also in violation of Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. 

Please carefully examine this complaint as my rights are being violated. 
I'm unable to acquire loans or credit that I desperately need right now to take care of my family. 
This information is damaging me. 
I'm unable to get a vehicle. 
I'm unable to purchase things that I need for my family, even though that I have a right to credit. 
I'm being denied it. 

15 U.S.C. 1681, Congressional Findings and Statement of Purpose, Say the Accuracy and Fairness of Credit Reporting.Congress makes the following findings : There is a need to ensure that consumer reporting agencies exercise their grave responsibilities with fairness, impartiality, and a respect for the consumer 's right to privacy. 


There is no respect for the consumer 's right to privacy. 
But there is a need to protect my right to privacy. 
Reporting my transaction history is illegal. 
Any and all consent to XXXX, XXXX, ( Furnisher of information to credit agencies ) whether it be verbal, non-verbal, written, implied or otherwise is revoked. 

15 U.S.C. Subsection 1681B says the permissible purposes of Consumer Reports, any consumer agency, consumer reporting agency may furnish a consumer report under the following circumstances and no other, in accordance with written instructions of the consumer according to whom it relates, which means they need my written consent to add anything to my consumer report and I did not give this authorization, which is a violation of the FCRA.

Furthermore, 15 U.S.C. 1681c says requirements relating to information contained in the Consumer Reports, except it's authorized under subsection b, no consumer reporting agency may make any consumer report containing any of the following items of information, any other adverse item of information other than convictions of crimes which annotates the report by more than seven years.

Well, I have no convictions of crime and therefore I should have no discrepancies or derogatory marks on my consumer report. 
This is yet another violation. My account is an adverse item they are reporting. 

15 U.S.C. 1681E, Compliance Procedures, states, Identity and Purposes of Credit Users. Every consumer reporting agency shall maintain reasonable procedures designed to avoid violations of Section 1681C of this title and to limit the furnishing of consumer reports to the purposes listed under Section 1681B. These procedures shall require that prospective users of information identify themselves, certify the purposes for which the information is sought, and certify that the information will be used for no other purpose.

Every consumer reporting agency shall make a reasonable effort to verify the identity of a new prospective user and the uses certified by such prospective use prior to furnishing such user consumer report.

No consumer reporting agency may furnish a consumer report to any person if has reasonable grounds for believing that the Consumer Report will not be used for a purpose listed in Section 1681B of the Title.

b. The Accuracy of the report whenever a Consumer Reporting Agency prepares a Consumer Report, it shall follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom the report relates, But the information on my report is inaccurate.

and information contained in Consumer Reports, they, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX XXXX are violating compliance procedures under this Title.

15 U.S.C. Subsection 1681N, Civil Liability for Willful Noncompliance, states that a. In general, any person who willfully fails to comply with any requirement imposed under this subchapter with respect to any consumer is liable to that consumer in an amount equal to the sum of at least {$1000.00}. 
Furthermore, if they can prove they willfully violated Section 1681N, they are liable to You're entitled to at least {$1000.00} per violation and any other damages sustained as a result for failure to follow the law.

And as I stated, I have damages because I've been unable to get a loan, I've been unable to get a vehicle, I've been unable to get credit.

I can only get a secure credit card right now because of all this damaging information on my credit report.

These various reporting agencies have a full understanding of the violations that I have stated to them after I complained the first time.

Each of these companies said in their agreements with consumers that they would follow the law and agreed to do so, but they are well aware that they are breaking the law.

15 U.S.C. 1681-O, Civil Liability for Negligent Noncompliance .

In general, any person who is negligent in failing to comply with any requirement imposed under this subchapter with respect to any consumer, is liable to be fined {$1000.00}, Is liable to that consumer in an amount equal to the sum of any actual damages sustained by the consumer as a result of the failure. Negligent non-compliance means the law was violated not on purpose but due to a lack of knowledge on the required reporting procedures.

15 U.S.C. 1681 S-2 states responsibilities of furnishers of information to consumer reporting agencies.

Number one, prohibition states that reporting information with actual knowledge of errors, a person shall not furnish any information relating to the consumer to any consumer reporting agency if the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate. 

The information on this report is highly inaccurate. 

These agencies have been notified that there's inaccurate information and they have not stopped reporting that information and they have not been able to prove that it is in fact valid. 
These violations of the F.C.R.A. are one of the reasons that I filed this complaint today and because I need your help.

The violations of the Privacy Act of 1974.

The term record means any item collection or grouping of information about an individual that is maintained by an agency including but not limited to his education, financial transactions and that contains his name or the identifying number, symbol or other identifying particular assigned to the individual.

This includes consumer reports.

Section B, Conditions of Disclosure states that no agency shall disclose any record which is contained in a system of records by any means of communication to any person or to another agency except pursuant to a written request by or with the prior written consent of the individual whom the record pertains.

I never gave any written consent nor did they send any request for my permission to disclose any of this information. Had they sent it, as theyre required by law to do, I would have denied consent.

Section 3711E of Title 31 states, When trying to collect a claim of the government under a law, the head of an executive, judicial, or legislative agency shall disclose to a consumer reporting agency information from a system of records that a person is responsible for a claim if the head of the agency has established procedures to get satisfactory assurances from each consumer reporting agency that the agency is complying with all laws of the United States related to providing consumer credit information.

As you can see, they violated the FCRA and the Privacy Act of 1974.

I have tried to opt out using the Opt Out Laws, Part 1016, Privacy of Consumer Financial Information in Regulation P.

12 C.F.R. Subsection 1016.1 Purpose and Scope. Purpose, this part, governs the treatment of non-public personal information about consumers by the financial institutions listed in paragraph B of this section. This part, one, requires a financial institution to provide notice to consumers about its privacy policies and practices.

I have been notified of no such privacy policy or practice.

Two, describes the conditions under which a financial institution may disclose non-public personal information about consumers to non-affiliated third parties, and three, provides a method for consumers to prevent a financial institution from disclosing that information to most non-affiliated third parties by opting out of that disclosure.

Every company owes me a privacy notice before they furnish any of my information on my consumer report and I have been given no such notice.

12 CFR 1016.4 Initial Privacy Notice to Consumers Required. It must be stated ... Providing clear and conspicuous notice that accurately reflects my privacy policies and practices to a customer, an individual who becomes your customer, except as provided of this subsection, and consumer, a consumer before you disclose any non-public personal information about the consumer to any non-affiliated third party.

12 CFR subsection 1016.7, the form of opt-out notice to consumers, opt-out methods, section A. The form of opt-out notice must provide a clear and conspicuous notice to each of the consumers that accurately explains the right to opt-out under that section.

The notice must state that you disclose or reserve the right to disclose non-public personal information about your consumer to a non-affiliated third party, and that the consumer has the right to opt-out of that disclosure and a reasonable means by which the consumer may exercise the opt-out right.

Two. Examples. Reasonable opt-out means you provide a reasonable means to exercise an opt-out right if you designate check-off boxes in a prominent position on the relevant forms with an opt-out notice, include a reply form together with the opt-out notice.

In the case of financial institutions described in section 1016.3, section 1, section 3 of this part includes the address to which the form should be mailed.

Unreasonable opt-out means that you do not provide a reasonable means of opting out if the only means of opting out is for the consumer to write his or her own letter to exercise that opt-out right, or the only means of opting out as described in any notice subsequent to the initial notice is the use of a check-off box that you provided with the initial notice but did not include with the subsequent notice.

Section G, time to comply with the opt-out.

They must comply with my consumer 's opt-out direction as soon as reasonably practicable after they received it, but they have not done so.

Section H, the continuing right to opt out. In general, a financial institution may not disclose non-public personal information to a non-affiliated third party unless the consumer is given the opportunity before the time that such information is initially disclosed to direct that such information not be disclosed to such third party and c. the consumer is given an explanation of how the consumer can exercise that non-disclosure option.

They were supposed to give me an opt-out notice for anything that was added to this report No such notice was ever given to me.

15 USC subsection 6805 states that the enforcement of all the infractions listed above must be directed to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

That is why I have contacted you to exercise my right to opt out of anything damaging on this report at any time, and these companies have not complied as soon as reasonably practicable after I sent them a notice.

They've only given me the unreasonable means to opt out, I had to write them my own letters directing them to stop reporting in accordance with the laws listed above, and they still have not stopped reporting. 
Please help me get access to my credit. 
Help me remove these damaging reports from my credit reports so that I can get credit, so that I can get a vehicle, loans, and general access to my credit so that I can take care of my family and our needs.

I am writing to formally demand a refund pertaining to in my name with Navient. I have carefully reviewed the loan agreement and believe that I am entitled to a refund based on the following grounds : 1098-E : According to my records which I have reviewed all my tax documents which have been completed by a licensed accountant per IRS standards with over 30 years of experience. I obtained copies of tax returns submitted to the IRS along my originals to ensure any discrepancies that may have been submitted on my end which no discrepancies found. However multiple discrepancies that were found on Navient 's part. I requested copies of all 1098-E forms from Navient which I received XX/XX/XXXX. I was not provided copies of the 1098-Es. The amounts on the document from Navient pertaining to the loan in question are inaccurate which is of concern and validates my payments were processed to a loan that is not mine. 

I spoke with XXXX XXXX XXXX who works in your consumer advocate department in reference to all the aboveXXXX XXXX also provided me an EIN that does not reflect the 1098-Es that I have and are not listed on the documents I obtained from the IRS. The EIN numbers on the 1098-Es all pertain to Federal Student loans. This is very concerning which validates that Navient listed this private loan under my federal loan account number and attached another account number to represent a private loan which would be beneficial for Navient upon tax filing.

Misrepresentation : I requested copies of all loan documents. I was provided documents that are concerning. I was provided two disclosures with different dates which I have questioned multiple times and not been provided an answer as to why the dates are different, a loan application that has a signature that is not mine along with no date. I was provided loan information that validates Navient consolidated a private and federal loan under the account number XXXX although uses XXXX and continued to accept payment. Interchanging loan numbers/account numbers/grouping has been an issue for many with Navient as mentioned in XXXX of the lawsuits. I expect Navient to rectify this by refunding the full loan amount, payments and interest. 
Transaction history varies from paper work I was provided in XX/XX/XXXX from the Navient website. Upon reviewing the Navient transaction list on the website a payment of {$1.00} is noted. A payment made that month was allocated to XXXX XXXX for {$100.00}. Navient transferred loans to XXXX that also do not reflect correct amount. 

Navient has had multiple lawsuits pertaining to unfair, deceptive practice and violating consumer protection laws. 
XXXX of the lawsuits was filed by The Massachusetts Attorney General along with other state XXXX XXXX. The lawsuits filed was pertaining to Navient violated consumer protection laws by engaging in unfair and deceptive servicing and collection practices and, as XXXX XXXX, originating predatory subprime private student loans. 
Another lawsuit filed by the CFPB because Navient XXXX XXXX at Every Stage of Repayment. Navient, Formerly Part of XXXX XXXX, Illegally Cheated Borrowers Out of Repayment Rights Through Shortcuts and Deception The settlement included conduct reforms, including prohibitions on unfair and deceptive conduct and terms designed to ensure that Navient improves its servicing and debt collection operations which Navient has not done. 


I have attached copies of relevant documents, including payment records and correspondence with Navient, to support my claim. I have also made attempts to resolve this matter through your customer service department, but have not received a satisfactory response. 

I demand that Navient rectify this situation within 30 days. Rectification is to include a full refund with in the 30 days from the date on this letter in the form of a check and remove this trade line from my credit report. Navient is to inform XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX along XXXX any other CRA that Navient reports XXXX.

09/12/24,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"I am writing to file a complaint against Navient Student Loans regarding the mishandling of a settlement payment that I was supposed to receive in XX/XX/XXXX. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I received a notice from the IRS stating that I had received income in the amount of {$5000.00} from a settlement with Navient. This settlement resulted from a lawsuit in which Navient was sued for charging military members and others improper fees. However, I never received this {$5000.00} check. I was not aware that I was part of a class action lawsuit, and I had never received any check or notification about this settlement. 

Upon receiving the IRS notice, I immediately contacted Navient to inquire about the supposed {$5000.00}. Navient informed me that the check had been sent out, but since I did not cash the check within the 90-day period before it was voided, the funds were then kept by Navient and distributed across my student loans in a way that did not benefit me. 

Furthermore, Navient provided me with the contact information for the company they used to distribute the checks. When I contacted this company, they could not provide me with any check number or confirmation that a {$5000.00} check had been mailed to my known address. 

Instead of benefiting me, Navient split the {$5000.00} between two small loans I had, one for {$2000.00} and another for {$3000.00}. This action did not benefit me as a consumer. If Navient had applied the {$5000.00} to pay off one of the loans, it would have been more advantageous for me. However, they chose to distribute the funds in a manner that did not consider my best interests. 

I submitted a complaint to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau back inXX/XX/XXXX regarding this issue. However, I do not believe I received a response or resolution to my complaint filed at that time. 

I feel that I have been wronged by Navients handling of this settlement payment. Not only did I not receive the check, but I was also denied the opportunity to use the funds in a way that would have benefited me the most.",None,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",GA,30331,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,09/12/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,10098161

I am not the only consumer having issues with Navient. They are not trying to resolve any issues. I was recently discharged from XXXX XXXX bankruptcy and my overall student debt was at {$45000.00}. Since I am a XXXX XXXX I applied for student loan forgiveness and my loans were consolidated. Navient was the servicer. Not one time did I receive notice in XX/XX/XXXX that I had a balance with Navient and that {$7000.00} was a private educational loan. They didn't attempt to call or anything. Before initially filing for bankruptcy when I was making payments with Navient, not one time was there a break down on statements indicating a public and private loan. Nevertheless they were provided with updated mailing addresses and telephone numbers as I went through a divorce. The only reason why I learned of the private loan was because I applied for a credit card to rebuild my credit and was denied because Navient reported to all credit bureaus delinquency dating back to XX/XX/XXXX. I immediately contacted Navient and got the run around. Finally XX/XX/XXXX I spoke with a Navient representative, filed a dispute with them to investigate the matter and at that time I spoke with a supervisor who told me it was my responsibility to update demographic information and I stated my information was updated back in XXXX before filing bankruptcy. I was then afforded an opportunity to enter a payment plan to where they can debit my account to take out monthly payments. They also told me that if I make 3 consecutive monthly payments, they will remove the late payments they reported to the credit bureaus and I have done just that. My first payment came out XX/XX/XXXX and I have been current since the agreement. Navient has not followed through with the agreement. They took the late payment off from XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, but put the late payments at the back end of the year for XXXX ( 30 days late ) and XXXX ( 60 days late ), but XX/XX/XXXX currently paid. So they didn't remove it just moved it back to the year end of XXXX. How can that be possible if my first agreed upon payment wasn't scheduled until XX/XX/XXXX. This has really ruined my credit. I am in the process of trying to get pre-approved for a mortgage and I can not move forward until they remove the late payments as agreed.

09/05/24,Debt collection,Other debt,False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,"I was contacted by Pioneer Credit Recovery by mail in a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX. In the letter, it was stated that I owe money to the Department of Defense for XXXX overpayment to XXXX XXXX for prescriptions dispensed to me between XXXX. The overpayment amount was {$3300.00}. That debt is legitimate and I own it and am glad to pay it. However, the total amount that Pioneer is trying to recover from me is over {$6100.00} due to administrative costs, penalties, and interest. 
I was shocked, as this was the first time I was hearing about any monies owed to XXXX, from nearly 7 years ago, no less. Apparently, XXXX XXXX  was sending correspondence regarding the overpayment to an address I was no longer living at, despite having my mail forwarded from the previous address to the new one via USPS. I have my ledger from my previous apartment that we were renting at the time showing when we made our last payment and the real estate contract showing when we purchased and moved into our new home. This happened nearly 11 months before they started sending letters about the overpayments. I can only assume that if the new residents received these letters meant for me, they tossed them rather than returning them to the sender. XXXX XXXX  states they never had any returned correspondence, therefore assuming I got the letters and was ignoring them. 
This information is beside the point, but my credit score has been over XXXX points for years. I have integrity and pay debts I owe ( obviously when it is a debt known to me ). I am in no way trying to avoid paying XXXX XXXX. The excessive fees and costs added on to the original debt, however, are unfair. I reached out to XXXX XXXX, who states they no longer own the debt and couldnt help. I then contacted XXXX XXXX to inquire about the debt and they couldnt find any record of it anywhere. I have spoken to XXXX from Pioneer Credit Recovery several times trying to explain the situation and have not gotten any alternative recommendations on how to appeal the tacked-on fees. She simply added that I can either take out a personal loan to pay the balance or my wages could begin being garnished or a lien could be placed on my home, which were all scary thoughts and made me very anxious. I sent a dispute letter on XX/XX/XXXX, which was forwarded to the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. They responded on XX/XX/XXXX by mail stating that the original debt owed to the Department of Defense was valid and to proceed with collection efforts. Again, I am happy to pay a debt I owe as long as I know I owe it.

I was unable to find any direct phone number to the XXXX XXXX Dispute Resolution division at the Treasury Bureau of the Fiscal Service. They only have a fax number and email address listed to the public for use if the consumer has any questions regarding the dispute. I sent an email to them on XX/XX/XXXX to further discuss everything previously laid out in this letter, and got an automated reply that I could expect a response to my inquiry within the next 60 days, which is not very helpful in reaching a prompt resolution while this debt continues to accrue interest. I also sent a letter by mail on XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX with an address provided by a XXXX representative during one of the handful of phone calls I made to them trying to get answers. As of today, Ive yet to get a response by telephone, ground mail or email from them. 
With fees and penalties accruing for 5 years before I was ever notified and made aware of the debt, I dont know who to appeal to at this point to discuss forgiveness of these extra charges. I would love to pay off the original amount I owe, make the situation right, and close the book on this, but Im feeling indignant as a responsible consumer. Every avenue I have gone down to try to amend this situation on my own has lead me to a dead end and Im running out of ideas on where to turn next. This is simply unjust practice by Pioneer Credit Recovery and I am hoping they can see that each individual has a different story, that some of us are responsible and honest and simply looking for resolution, and that wrongs can be righted in a situation such as this. 

I have enclosed all documentation and correspondence between Pioneer and myself since XX/XX/XXXX, along with my documentation proving I was no longer at the address on file with XXXX XXXX when they began sending me notices about the debt back in XXXX, and my letter to the XXXX. Hopefully you are able to help me make some headway with Pioneer Credit Recovery or XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX to settle this debt fairly.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",MT,598XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,09/05/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,10031321

09/18/24,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Struggling to repay your loan,Problem with your payment plan,"I'm uncertain if I should or should not consolidate my ( XXXX ) loans? I have been paying consistently for over 14 years, after probably 6 years of deferment and forbearance ( that I was mislead into doing because I was steered that way, given my circumstances then, but... never advised of the effect it would have on my balance, or ballooning it as it has or ever advised of OTHER options ). I was told just last Monday XX/XX/XXXX by Navient that I should "" strongly consider consolidation '' as it would "" increase my chances of receiving debt forgiveness '' as opposed to not doing it and only having the lessor amount forgiven ( if at all ) and still be stuck with the higher loan to pay off then ... Is this an accurate statement, do you know? I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO BELIEVE OR WHO TO TRUST ANYMORE because of all the bad information I've received since XXXX with XXXX XXXX, my servicer then. And, by the way, I made a one-time, lump sum payment around XXXX to XXXX XXXX for XXXX initial balance then, in the amount of {$5000.00} and THEY FAILED TO RECORD IT and THERE IS NO RECORD of it, and IT NEVER CARRIED OVER TO Navient when they obtained my loan, probably around XXXX? 

That is the only reason I would even consider consolidation, because my current rate is 3.5 % and it will go up if I consolidate, but it seems REGARDLESS, that my debt fails to decrease because Navient has FAILED TO INFORM ME OF Charges that I've incurred, which I just found out again XX/XX/XXXX, and explains why my record of my current balance fail to match their "" current balance '' and we're off by more than {$15000.00}! And, by the way, on SEVERAL occasions I've been promised records, but they NEVER ARRIVE in the mail, even after I've verified my address, and I've also been told sometime they XXXX not provided such records ... really makes no sense, but I digress. I finally obtained XXXX sets and have cross-checked them and compared them to my records and again, the math never added up, but once I was advised just last week of "" hidden charges that were never disclosed '' that was the missing link and all of a sudden, now I know why- this information was disclosed to me by the last Rep I spoke with, but it still fails to resolve the difference in the supposed outstanding balance. 

I'm currently on an income-based repayment plan ( as of XX/XX/XXXX ), because I'm no longer able to pay the amount I was paying on my graduated repayment plan ( which was a complete rip off by the way, but was the ONLY OPTION I WAS OFFERED in XXXX when I was making payments then but was trying to work with them to actually make progress.. all the while just being financially enslaved to them for NO RESOLVE to my balance ), that I've been paying all these past XXXX or so years. 

The other "" kicker '' that really gets my goat is that my loan was originally XXXX upon my graduation in XXXX, then after all the deferment/forbearance I was steered into ( and given NO OTHER OPTIONS ), it was all of a sudden XXXX. I've been paying monthly, non-stop, every month, even during XXXX, I haven't missed XXXX payment since this plan started and even before when I was paying religiously each month, for over XXXX, XXXX even be 19 years, according to my records. According to my calculations, I should only owe about XXXX or XXXX at XXXX Navient 's XXXX they say I still owe is OVER XXXX ...! As of today. Complete JOKE. No way to run a repayment plan for anyone or any reason. 

And every time I call, I get a new person and its a never-ending joke and I have to start all over and go with what THAT PERSON THINKS is "" best '' and what they actually feel like telling me and offering me, regardless of what might be best for the situation. 

Not too mention ever since repaying my loans, I've been charges countless fee 's and interest, seemingly for NOTHING and to "" bring my account current '' yet it never seems to make a difference with the balance, probably been charged multiple fee 's for the same missed or deferred payment, have been denied access to obtain records of my transaction/payment history, been unsuccessful to have them research and conclude about the missing and never accounted for one-time lump sum $ XXXX payment I made early on ( and I no longer bank with XXXX XXXX, so have XXXX access or records of my own, unfortunately ), have continuously received confusing and conflicting and vague information about options, repayment programs, forgiveness, qualifications, and other forms and options for repayment and/or relief, have been steered into interest accruing options such as forbearance and deferment without proper and clearly explained consequences and effects all while never been offered any other options that would've avoided ballooning my balance ( if in fact it is correct ), and it has just gone unresolved ever since I have been repaying, causing undue stress, anguish, frustration and costed me thousands apparently, never making much progress in actually paying down the balance, according to their records. All with no real explanation or information to justify, backup and explain their conclusion and calculations.

I was never warned that I would lose all rights to a refund in any circumstance, including BDTR. Lenders lobbied to make all of the same terms and conditions as Federal loans so that the government could not offer better rates and take profit away from them. 

No borrower received any better rate or service by staying with Navient, the interest rates are the same. There was no benefit for borrowers, in fact many of the benefits that Federal loans have, were taken away. And Navient has a long history of manipulating and neglecting borrowers.

They are Federally insured and backed, would they not get paid back anyway?

09/04/24,Student loan,Private student loan,Getting a loan,Confusing or misleading advertising,"Many students, including myself, were misled by Navient ( formerly Sallie Mae ) into securing predatory private loans to fund education at for-profit online institutions, such as The XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX owned by XXXX XXXX XXXX As stated in this XXXX  Press Release : Art Institutes Students Secure Big Borrower Defense Win with {$6.00} XXXX Group Discharge https : XXXX XXXX also partnered with Sallie Mae ( now known as Navient ), to convince XXXX borrowers to take out private student loans to augment their federal student loans. These private loans enabled XXXX to maintain access to federal student aid dollars, and Navient benefited by being a preferred lender of federally-guaranteed student loans for AI students. Both XXXX and Navient knew students would not be able to repay these subprime loans and had a side agreement that protected Navient against losses. 
I was enrolled at The XXXX XXXX XXXX California, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) between XXXX to XXXX. They used deceptive tactics to help augment private loans with their preferred lender, Navient. 
Some of the deceptive practices involved using high pressure tactics. An example of this was : Every school year I would meet with the Financial Aid Officer, and they would encourage me to fill out my FAFSA application / Federal Loans application, and Private Loan applications right before my next class would start.

This was a rushed process, and I was uninformed and not encouraged to look at all the applications they were getting me to fill out. There was almost no explanation, the focus was just to get me to fill out all the necessary applications they needed so they could quickly process everything to enroll me into the next school year.

There was a sense of urgency that they had impressed upon me to quickly fill out all these applications on-line without reading all the fine print.

I was pressured and misled into taking out high interest private loans at variable interest rates starting around 12 %. These loans included 3 Signature Student loans : XXXX Student Signature Loan Disbursement Date : XX/XX/XXXX Original Principal : {$13000.00} XXXX Student Signature Loan Disbursement Date : XXXXXX/XX/XXXX Original Principal : {$1100.00} XXXX Student Signature Loan Disbursement Date : XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  Original Principal : {$12000.00} Since the interest rates are so high on these loans, I have never been able to make meaningful progress towards paying off the original principal. Most of the payments were just going to the inflated interest rates. 
In addition to the School 's brochure/advertisement for XXXX  graduates stating that Web Design & Interactive Media Degree holders received an average salary of {$46000.00} a year within 6 months of graduation, Administrative Representative XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX mislead many students and I about the prospects of quality future employment by telling my graduating class of XXXX  and I that we would make at least {$50000.00} a year right out of school. Even though I graduated with Honors, due to the outdated instructional methods and curriculum, I realized I was ill-prepared for entry level positions in Web Development. 
After I graduated, I was only able to get a part-time position, paying {$17.00} per hour ( roughly {$21000.00} a year ). 
Within a year I was able to get a full-time position paying a salary that was significantly less than the expectation of {$50000.00} a year touted in oral statements by the faculty and significantly less than {$46000.00} a year as stated in the written brochure for the graduating class of XXXX. 
The combination of ads and brochures on inflated job placement and inflated salary figures, predatory and aggressive recruiting maneuvers, and high pressure tactics has been detrimental to my financial and mental health since XXXX. As a result of all of this Ive had to live with my parents for an extended period of time after graduation ; Ive also had to put off buying a house, buying a car, providing for a family, saving for retirement, mental health treatment, and delaying urgent dental procedures. 
I was in the first group eligible for discharge in the Borrower Defense Program under the settlement in Sweet Vs. Cardona. This case was related to fraudulent and deceptive practices of the XXXX XXXX and other for-profit schools. This led to the discharge of my federal loans totaling ( {$77000.00} ), a refund on the amount I paid ( {$18000.00} ) and the restoration of my credit. 
The XXXX XXXX and their parent company, XXXX, were subject to investigations by various state attorneys general and found to have engaged in deceptive practices. In response to widespread allegations of fraud and misconduct by The XXXX XXXX, the XXXX administration recently announced a comprehensive loan discharge for students enrolled at these institutions from XX/XX/XXXX, to XX/XX/XXXX. 
Navient, which was sued by the attorneys general of 39 states for its role in facilitating these predatory loans, had a specific arrangement with for-profit schools during the early XXXX, making it a "" preferred '' lender. Despite this, the settlement terms provided by Navient were considerably inadequate, excluding many borrowers who took loans for attendance at approximately 150 for-profit online schools, unless they resided in certain states or had not defaulted for at least seven months during a specified period. I was one of many who were excluded. 
There was a class action lawsuit against Navient. ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the XXXX XXXX XXXX New York XXXX Navient agreed to a {$16.00} XXXX settlement to resolve a class action lawsuit claiming that student loan debt owned by the company should have been dischargeable during bankruptcy. I was also one of many who were not eligible for this relief. 
Moreover, Navient exited the federal student loan servicing business amidst legislative and advocacy scrutiny, following allegations of steering borrowers away from income-driven repayment plans towards forbearance, an action for which they had to provide restitution. 
Navient has also faced multiple lawsuits for other predatory lending and illegal collection practices. Currently, Navient is distributing "" applications '' to select students who may qualify for Borrower Defense claims against their schools. However, this process feels unnecessary and opaque, as Navient is already aware of the affected students. 
Under the FTC 's "" Holder Rule, '' Navient is accountable for these predatory loans issued in association with for-profit online schools.

I am sure this was a big win for Navient, but what a sham of a settlement deal for the rest of borrowers scammed into taking loans to at least XXXX for profit schools. After the AG settlement, didn't Navient also get out of the Federal student loan business due to scrutiny from lawmakers and borrower advocates? Didn't Navient have to pay restitution to the Federal student loan borrowers for not informing students of IDR/IBR payments students could have enrolled in, but instead steered toward forbearance?

09/13/24,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"XX/XX/XXXX Consumer Financial Protection Bureau XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, IA XXXX Subject : Complaint Against Navient Corporation for High Interest Rates , Poor Account Management , and Misleading Practices Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to file a formal complaint against Navient Corporation regarding the mismanagement of my private student loans and their deceptive practices. The loans, which were originally intended to help me finance my education at XXXX XXXX XXXX  have ballooned into an overwhelming financial burden due to high, variable interest rates and misleading servicing practices. I believe that Navients actions have been predatory and harmful, trapping me in debt that feels impossible to escape. Below is a summary of the loans, as well as the critical issues I have faced. 

Loan Summary : I currently hold five private student loans, totaling {$61000.00}, with interest rates ranging from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. These loans were disbursed between XXXX and XXXX and have been in repayment since XXXX. Despite making consistent payments, the high interest rates have caused the loan balances to balloon over time, and the principal has barely reduced. Here is a brief overview of each loan : Loan 1 ( Account No : XXXX ) Originally {$4000.00}, now has a balance of {$5700.00} with a XXXX XXXX interest rate. 
Loan 2 ( Account No : XXXX ) Originally {$5000.00}, now has a balance of {$6600.00} with an XXXX XXXX interest rate. 
Loan 3 ( Account No : XXXX ) Originally {$3800.00}, now has a balance of {$5100.00} with an XXXX XXXX interest rate. 
Loan 4 ( Account No : XXXX ) Originally {$15000.00}, now has a balance of {$36000.00} with a XXXX XXXX interest rate. 
Loan 5 ( Account No : XXXX ) Originally {$5000.00}, now has a balance of {$7500.00} with a XXXX XXXX interest rate. 

Key Issues : 1. Unreasonably High and Ballooning Interest Rates : The interest rates on my loans, which range from XXXX XXXX to a staggering XXXX XXXX, are outrageously high and have caused my debt to balloon over time. Loan 4, for example, has accumulated {$38000.00} in interestmore than double its original principal of {$15000.00}. This practice of allowing interest to compound to such an extent feels predatory, and I believe it should be considered illegal, as it keeps borrowers trapped in a cycle of debt without a clear path to repayment. 

2. Poor Account Management : Navients handling of my account has been nothing short of frustrating. Despite my regular payments, the principal on many of these loans remains largely unchanged. Representatives I have spoken with often provide confusing and inconsistent information, leaving me uncertain about how my payments are being applied. I have little confidence in their ability to manage my account properly. 

3. Misleading Co-Signer Release Practices : Navient repeatedly assured me that after a certain number of on-time payments, my co-signer could be released from their obligation. However, despite meeting the payment requirements, I have encountered ever-changing eligibility criteria and have yet to secure the release of my co-signer. This has caused significant stress for both myself and my co-signer, who was misled into believing they would be freed from responsibility. 

4. Deceptive Rate Reduction Program : Navients Rate Reduction Program initially appeared to offer temporary relief by lowering my interest rate for six months, but the rates quickly returned to their original levels, erasing any short-term benefit. Instead of providing meaningful financial assistance, this program only delayed the inevitable burden of high-interest payments and prolonged my repayment period. The program seems designed to create the illusion of assistance while further entangling borrowers in debt. 

5. Lack of Education and Transparency : Throughout my interactions with Navient, I have sought clear guidance and information about my repayment options, interest accrual, and the status of my loans. Unfortunately, the agents I have spoken with lack the knowledge or training necessary to provide this information, leaving me confused about my financial standing and options for paying off my loans.

Personal Impact : When I took out these loans, I was young and uneducated about financial literacya luxury not afforded in the low-income environment where I grew up. I believed that taking out student loans was the only way to access a better future. Now, at XXXX XXXX XXXX, I see clearly the lies I was told. Like so many others, I was assured that education was the key to achieving the XXXX XXXX. Instead, I find myself trapped by overwhelming debt and mismanagement. This debt has impacted every aspect of my lifemy ability to buy a home, start a family, and live the life I worked so hard to achieve. What was supposed to be an investment in my future has instead become a never-ending financial burden. 

My Request : I am asking the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to investigate Navients handling of my loans, with particular attention to the following : The application of my payments and why there has been minimal reduction in my principal. 

The legal and ethical implications of allowing interest to accrue to such an excessive degree. 

A full review of my eligibility for co-signer release and transparency regarding the requirements. 

The impact of Navients Rate Reduction Program on the life of my loan and overall balance.

I believe that Navients practices have been predatory and detrimental to my financial future. If these issues are not addressed, I am prepared to seek legal representation to explore all available options for relief. I hope that by filing this complaint, I can receive the support needed to bring resolution to this situation. 

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your response and hope that this complaint will lead to meaningful action.

They call my co signer all day every day and have left him messages. We are divorced and he has a limited income as well, he can not afford payments. They do not leave me any messages and call me from different numbers. I had been working with an advocate by the name of XXXX XXXX XXXX and have asked her repeatedly to call me but she does not respond. I have asked representatives to connect me to her and some say the can not, some say she is not available and some have disconnected me. I can not afford to pay {$1300.00} a month and I am asking for some restructuring. I do not have the credit to refinance. My co signer does not have the money to make payments either. I am going to have to default on this debt in order for the interest to stop and so I can finally pay down this debt with am monthly amount that I can actually afford. 

I recently joined a XXXX XXXX for support with Student Loans and Navient. There are some folks on there who are being very rude to customers who are venting and asking for private loan advice. One person who I believe works for Navient is named XXXX XXXX. It is not okay for Navient workers to be be demeaning and abusive to customers who are just seeking support and advice. I have sent screen shots of these conversations to XXXX XXXX XXXX my advocate. The XXXX XXXX is called Navient XXXX XXXX XXXX. It is a public group with XXXX members. You will see some very rude comments from XXXX XXXX or also XXXX XXXX. This should not be allowed. 

In addition, I received in the mail a few pink padded bubble envelopes with the return address listed only as "" XXXX XXXX on the return label ( not Navient ) and a return address of XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX but nothing indicating it was from Navient.

I have also been told different stories about different programs from many different representatives. No one can assist me at this point.

This is all within, I'd say, XXXX to early XX/XX/year>. I kept checking back, and it continued to say I had no payment due. I thought this was accurate after checking multiple times, because my husband 's student loans are on pause though the government and he has no payments due through his servicer. So, I assumed this information from Navient was correct. 

At some point in mid-late XXXX XX/XX/year>, Navient said that they would no longer be holding my loans ( told me via the online portal when I signed in ), and that they had moved my loans to XXXX. I tried to create an account and log in with XXXX to make payment, but it wouldn't let me -- it said something like "" we don't recognize '' me/my account/my loans/etc.. I don't quite remember exactly what it said, but, basically, it was saying they didn't have my loans. 

At this point, I have zero access to any of my private student loans. Zero access to see them or pay them, or do anything at all, through either Navient or XXXX ( I logged back into Navient and they were still not there ). They just disappeared from the the portal entirely at Navient, and XXXX has zero record of me. 

So, here we are on XX/XX/year>, and, now, magically, my loans are still with Navient and not XXXX. I can now see all information. Now it says I have an "" overdue payment '' and fees associated with the late payment, plus an upcoming payment. Keep in mind : I had *zero * access to my loans, and literally no way to make payment because the loans weren't even listed on Navient -- it's as if I never had a loan at all -- there was zero information at all. Now they are trying to push forbearance/deferment on me, all while harassing the co-signer, but they haven't even called me once to the best of my knowledge.

Now I'm in a financial situation where I can't pay until the next paycheck, because who can afford student loan payments and rent on just one paycheck? That means I'll get more late fees,
they will keep harassing my co-signer until it's paid, "" late payment '' goes on my credit report, and now I have to somehow manage two payments for Navient *alone* on one paycheck. These aren't my only loans, these are only a small fraction. 

None of this would've happened if the accurate information was listed. None of this would've happened if I had *access* to pay my loans when they were actually due. How are these practices legal? 

No, I didn't take screenshots. I should have. But the XXXX  of figuring everything out, and spending literally hours to *find* where my loans are to make payment -- it doesn't even matter. At what point is any of this THEIR responsibility?

08/22/24,Student loan,Private student loan,Issue with income share agreement,Marketing or disclosure issues,"In XXXX I applied to a school of XXXX XXXX. This school of XXXX XXXX guided me through the process of obtaining financial abilities to be able to fund the education that they would provide. Without this offer, I would not have been able to afford to go to school, and I was told I would not have any problems finding job placement. Federal loans were offered and would not cover all expenses, to which I was told that Sallie Mae would extend an offer to me to cover remaining expenses. The school not only marketed the school to offer students job placement afterwards, told the students that we would have no problem finding jobs that would more than well be able to pay off our loans, but also withheld the fact that they were a non-accredited school and that in order for us to practice in any other state besides New York or Ohio that we would have to take another exam called the XXXX, which is a foreign equivalency exam to be able to practice in the United States. I would have to take this test regardless of where I was born, even though I was born in the United States. This test had a XXXX wait period and cost an additional {$6000.00}. This was not disclosed to us until XXXX years into our education of our XXXX XXXX year long curriculum. Additionally, this university had over a 50 % failure ratemaking it even harder for borrowers to repay if they did not graduate. In XXXX Navient was found guilty of such predatory behavior. Until I was able to take this test, I was forced to live in a different state than my family and pay New York State income tax of nearly 30 % or my low income. There were additional monies that needed to be made available for rent food general living expenses, and we were not allowed to work while being in school and then guided towards taking out additional private loans because federal loans were max out. The dean and counselors stated that we would be more than eligible for entrance into the clinical year at stateside schools when in fact, there were only handful of schools that would admit us as non-accredited students coming from a foreign school and space was limited to XXXX or XXXX students over just a handful of schools. The university advertised that we would be in school year-round and be able to get us out into the workforce sooner, have excellent hands-on surgical skills, meanwhile, the school was not a accredited during my time at school. Sallie mae and now Navient, has used this to their advantage in predatory acts against students in financial need and distress. Upon graduation, it was very clear that employers did not want to hire graduate from a non-accredited school, which was direct opposite of what we were told. Navient offered forbearance after forbearance to help me out ; unknowingly that the interest would rack up and then they would charge interest on this interest. My initial loan was in XXXX for {$130000.00}. My current outstanding balance is {$100000.00}. Total interest paid to date is over 50 % of the original disbursement. Total interest paid to date is {$68000.00}. I have requested my transaction history from XXXX until today and the money that I submit for payment is partially being applied to interest first, then fees and lastly the principal balance. Over the last 15 years, all amounts are varied..even with the same amount paid monthly. The amount that Navient applies to interest payments are 95 % of the time much higher than what is applied to the principaleven 15 years later ie XX/XX/XXXX payment of {$1100.00} : {$190.00} went to principal {$900.00} went to interest : XX/XX/XXXX payment of {$1100.00} : {$280.00} went to principal {$810.00} went to interest. When I call to speak to someone at Navient they tell me that they are not sure and have placed me on hold and then come back to tell me the payment i make is put toward principle, interest and fees. I had to ask several times to clarify in WHAT order ; she then stated fees first, then interest and lastly principal. She told me that interest daily is {$27.00} ( $ XXXX ) which should be decreasing as the principal is also deceasing. 

Navient issued me a subprime private loan knowing I would have great difficulty in paying the money back graduating from a school with over 50 % failure rate and being unaccredited, and by driving to mislead me into forbearances, which stopped me from paying down the principal on my loan and led me to accumulate more debt and never-ending interest payments.",None,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",FL,33411,None,Consent provided,Web,08/22/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,9893165

XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Washington, D.C. XXXX Subject : **Complaint Regarding Private Student Loans Navient Corporation** To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to formally submit a complaint against **Navient Corporation** regarding their handling of my private student loan, which I believe involved deceptive and unfair practices that have caused significant financial hardship. 

I obtained a private student loan from Navient in XXXX, and have since experienced a variety of issues, including but not limited to : - **Steering into costly forbearance options** instead of receiving assistance with more appropriate repayment plans. 
- A lack of transparency regarding the terms and conditions of my loan, including changes to the interest rate and payment schedules. 
- **Failure to provide proper disclosures** at the time of loan origination, resulting in financial harm. 
- Deceptive practices, including **misleading communication regarding repayment options** and my eligibility for alternative solutions, which led to a worsening of my financial situation. 

These practices are consistent with the issues raised in the recent settlement between Navient and several states ' Attorneys General. I believe my case falls under similar circumstances, particularly concerning **unfair loan servicing practices** that were detailed in the settlement. 

I kindly request that the CFPB investigate my case and take appropriate action to address these concerns. I have included copies of my loan documents, correspondence with Navient, and any other relevant materials as evidence. 

Please let me know if any additional documentation or information is needed to facilitate your investigation. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response and assistance in resolving this issue.

07/31/24,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"Dear Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I am writing to follow up on my ongoing case with Navient regarding my school misconduct student loan discharge application. While I appreciate the assistance provided by the CFPB that led to my application being acknowledged and marked as pending in my Navient account, I have yet to receive an official response from Navient regarding the approval of my discharge application. 

Moreover, XXXX of my private loans is currently marked as "" suspended, '' and I recently received correspondence indicating that my loans will be serviced by XXXX starting in XXXX. Despite these developments, my primary concern remains the need for a full refund of all payments made on these predatory loans. 

My loans amounts have been updated to XXXX balance which is a step in the right direction however these loans were based on aggressive and deceptive practices and warrant a full refund. 

Background : I was enrolled at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, which was forced to close due to numerous violations, including aggressive and deceptive recruitment practices. The financial aid representative, XXXX XXXX, used predatory lending tactics to coerce me and my father, XXXX XXXX XXXX, into taking out these loans. These tactics included pressuring immediate enrollment decisions, misleading information about the educational services and employability of graduates, and obtaining our contact information through deceptive means. 

Given the aggressive and deceptive nature of the recruitment and lending practices employed, these loans are predatory and fall under the purview of the Department of Education 's regulations against such practices. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX : I have already successfully received a borrower defense loan discharge for my federal loans, including processed refunds. This outcome further validates the predatory and unlawful nature of the practices employed by The XXXX XXXX, and underscores the need for similar action regarding my private loans serviced by Navient. 

Request for Refund : In addition to the discharge of the outstanding loan balances, I am requesting a full refund of all payments made to Navient on these predatory private loans. The XXXX XXXX and the documented predatory lending practices used by XXXX XXXX XXXX justify this request. It is imperative that Navient acknowledges the harm caused by these predatory practices and refunds the payments to rectify the situation fully. 

I urge the CFPB to assist in ensuring that Navient not only processes my loan discharge application promptly but also issues a full refund for all payments made on these predatory loans. I have provided substantial evidence to support my case, and I am confident that the predatory nature of these loans warrants this action. 

Thank you for your continued support in addressing this matter.

Specifically, I was led to believe that the financial assistance offered to me primarily consisted of grants and federal Pell Grants. However, I have recently discovered that a significant portion of my financial aid package includes private loans, which were not clearly communicated to me at the time of my enrollment. 

When I initially inquired about financial aid, I was assured that most of my educational expenses would be covered through grants and federal assistance. At no point was I adequately informed about the inclusion of private loans, nor was I made aware of the implications of accepting such loans. This lack of transparency has placed me in an unexpected and difficult financial position. 

As a student, I trusted the guidance and information provided by the school 's financial aid office. The omission of critical details regarding the private loans has had a significant impact on my financial planning and overall educational experience. Had I been fully informed about the nature of my financial aid package, I would have explored other options or made different decisions regarding my education funding. 

I kindly request the following actions be taken to rectify this situation : 1. A thorough review and clarification of my financial aid package, including a detailed breakdown of the sources of funding. 
2.Improved transparency and communication practices for future students to ensure that they receive complete and accurate information about their financial aid packages.

09/14/24,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Struggling to repay your loan,"Problem with forgiveness, cancellation, or discharge","Reason for this complaint : I feel Navient participated in deceptive practice by not informing me of the XXXX  status that was automatically dropped on my loan account when I re-entered school for my XXXX XXXX. Furthemore, I did not know at the time that an XXXX  status disqualified any repayment from going towards forgiveness. Furthermore, I was not informed that there was a form that I could have filled out to nullify that disqualification and have my payments count. To me, my financial assistance in pursuing my XXXX was separate from my assistance for my XXXX. I did not inquire any financial government assistance for my XXXX and was paying for that as I attended right out. So, I was working while continuing to pay on my XXXX loan while attending school part-time ( paying for that separately ). During the XXXX  period, I paid {$12000.00} towards my XXXX loan. That totaled XXXX payments that I later found out would not count towards PSLF. Below explain the headache I went through trying to get a straight answer of why my {$12000.00} plus was omitted. Below also explains how I had to find out the way an XXXX  status hurts the borrower and how it is placed on their record through a XXXX search, not Navient. 

Background : My student loan was for me to receive my XXXX XXXX from XXXX University. I attended a local satellite location but later attended it strictly online. Upon graduating, I made my first repayment to Sallie Mae on XX/XX/XXXX. I continued to make my payments when my loan was switched to Navient. Due to financially hard times, my last payment was recorded on XX/XX/XXXX. According to the limited PSLF waiver, whether my payments were partial, full or on time, I made XXXX payments towards my student loan. I was employed full-time at an approved not-for-profit organization for XXXX  years during my repayment period. Every required stipulation I needed in order to be qualified for forgiveness under the limited PSLF was completed. I checked every box in order to have the remaining balance forgiven. My application was completed and faxed on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX sent a follow-up letter that my application was successfully received. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a statement from aidVantage that my total loan was eligible for consolidation. On XX/XX/XXXX, prior to the deadline, I received a letter from Navient that my total loan was paid in full as a result of my recent loan consolidation. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter that the U.S. Dept. of Education reassigned my new federal consolidated student loan to XXXX for servicing. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a XXXX letter that I had eligible loans and my employment qualified for PSLF. When I finally received my letter, what I expected to be my forgiveness letter from XXXX, it was actually a letter stating that I was basically short of the needed XXXX payments in order to be forgiven the remaining balance. I was puzzled and submitted a claim to get answers. I submitted so many cases and always got the run around for a simple question of why XXXX of my payments were not being counted. I submitted so many cases because I always got some copy/paste rebuttal and my case would be close. At first, it appeared there was a question about my employment and my payment periods. Below details the information from the letter. I reiterated the information in many of my cases. This is very lengthy due to me wanting to be very thorough, clear and for them to capture my understanding of why I thought the omission of my payment periods was unfair. I contacted XXXX via both electronic cases and actual phone calls. I focused mainly online to have records of my correspondences. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted a case to XXXX. 

I was looking over my progress and noticed that XXXX qualifying repayment periods were omitted or looked over. 

I started my repayment in XX/XX/XXXX. The system totally skipped over my employment months/years XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX ( below shows how the system skipped this period ). It went from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. The qualifying periods that are missing equals XXXX. 

I was employed full-time to the same employer during all those XXXX skipped periods as I was during the periods that were counted ( XXXX ). The "" Need Employment Certification '' count keeps increasing because the system is calculating the periods XX/XX/XXXX to present. Furthermore, the system also states that all those payment periods that "" need employment certification '' are eligible but require approved employment in order to qualify. 

My missed XXXX employment periods were eligible and should have been counted as qualified. The skipped XXXX periods in which I submitted proof that I was making payments should have been counted as qualified as well. The payments were there and so was my employment. The XXXX already qualified plus the skipped XXXX that should also be qualified equals XXXX. It says forgiveness is at ( XXXX ) and that I have XXXX of XXXX to go. If the system had counted my XXXX payment periods ( months ), and my XXXX missed payments, I would actually be over by XXXX periods and XXXX payments respectively with nothing left to pay. 

Please recalculate this again and post the correct information. I do have a copy of every payment I sent Navient and proof of my entire qualified employment periods from XXXX. 
Thank you I copied and pasted the above later in a case to FSA in XXXX. That case # XXXX is below. 

At the time, I was just confused and totally forgot I had went back to school for my XXXX. It was a slow process that was being stretched out over years in which I didnt even complete. So in the case to XXXX, I did mention that I was not attending any higher educational institutions during the XXXX skipped periods above. I received my last degree in XXXX, which is true because I didnt complete my XXXX. I was in full repayment mode in XX/XX/XXXX. 

The below information was in another case that just repeated the above but included this detail. 

These were details in a letter I received and on XXXX site. 

What the XXXX employment periods that were actually counted said : XXXX DL Consolidation Unsubsidized XX/XX/XXXX PSLF, TEPSLF  Qualifying - Special Waiver View Details = Due to the special waiver, this payment period is eligible and qualifying. 

XXXX DL Consolidation Subsidized XX/XX/XXXX PSLF, TEPSLF Qualifying - Special Waiver View Details = Due to the special waiver, this payment period is eligible and qualifying. 

What the XXXX "" Need Employment Certification '' said : XXXX DL Consolidation Unsubsidized XX/XX/XXXX PSLF, TEPSLF Employment Not Certified View Details = This payment period is eligible but requires approved employment in order to qualify. 

XXXX DL Consolidation Subsidized XX/XX/XXXX PSLF, TEPSLF Employment Not Certified View Details = This payment period is eligible but requires approved employment in order to qualify. 

This is true because I was no longer employed as of XX/XX/XXXX. 

The details "" Due to the special waiver, this payment period is eligible and qualifying '' should also be applied to the XXXX periods. 

XXXX Replied : Thank you for contacting XXXX, We apologize for any inconvenience this XXXX have caused. When payment months are not listed as eligible or ineligible, this indicates that XXXX is still updating your payment counts. Your approved qualifying employment has been applied to your account, but we have not yet received permission from FSA to update the account with the remaining qualifying payment updates. As we receive approval for the updates, we apply all qualifying payments to your account. Your payment counts will not reflect the actual count until all of the updates are complete. Continue to monitor your account on the XXXX portal for any adjustments. We appreciate your continued patience. 

Since XXXX stated that the hold up is with FSA, I requested an appeal and asked for a contact person at FSA. 

I replied to XXXX : Hi, in regards to your response to my account, you stated that you have not heard from or been released by FSA to update my account with the remaining qualifying payment updates. Can I get a contact from somebody at FSA in which to appeal? This just doesn't seem logical for the system to have skipped all those eligible payment periods ( month & years ) when it is on record that proves my 20 years straight employment. It appears those missing periods were deliberately skipped because this is not logical. Please make this make sense. I would like to submit an appeal please. Thank you I didnt wait to hear back from XXXX about this and decided to contact FSA directly to get more information. 

FSA dispute case # XXXX Hello, I have contacted XXXX several times via telephone about this issue but keep getting the same run around. I decided to send an email. I sent them the same details above when looking over my progress. 

I followed up with another case XXXX where I had a separate concern. An aid worker replied that he/she would add any new information provided in that case to my existing dispute case, XXXX and closed it. 

In case XXXX I politely requested to be informed of any reason ( s ) to why the system would erase, omit, skip years of my qualified employment that I sent proof of in order to adversely deem me XXXX payments short of the required XXXX. A total of XXXX payment periods/ approved employment were skipped. I listed all the months and years in my case. Furthermore, I submitted proof of every payment made during each of those skipped XXXX periods. Why would the system do that? The system is taking away rightful years of my employment but wants to mention the months/years after I left as such : ** This payment period is eligible but requires approved employment in order to qualify. ** The system is omitting my life and years of working and that is not fair. 
Can somebody please address my concern regarding my employment being omitted? 

I didn't see where the aid worker included this information to this case. Thus, I added a message that was attached to case XXXX. 


FSA response : Dear *****, Thank you for contacting the U.S. Department of Education 's office of Federal Student Aid ( FSA ).

FSA is currently in the process of automatically applying Payment Count Adjustment credit across certain borrower accounts. Borrowers will automatically receive payment credit on their loans for the following periods : any months in a repayment status, regardless of the payments made, loan type, or repayment plan ; XXXX or more months of consecutive forbearance and/or XXXX or more months of cumulative forbearance ; any months spent in economic hardship or military deferments in XXXX or later ; any months spent in any deferment ( with the exception of in-school deferment ) prior to XXXX ; and any time in repayment ( or deferment or forbearance, if applicable ) on earlier loans before consolidation of those loans into a consolidation loan. After the automatic adjustments are completed in XXXX, the FSA Ombudsman Office will begin the process of reviewing requests for manual adjustments. Please note that manual account reviews can not be conducted before the automatic account adjustments are completed. However, we will keep your complaint open until we can complete the manual review. That means your complaint may remain open for several months. 

The gist of case XXXX w/o repeating most of what Ive already included is below. 

Hello... I recently submitted a complaint regarding missed/skipped employment and payments. I received the same run around that the servicer gives me. Can somebody please at least give me a logical reason why the system would totally omit my employment and thus XXXX payment periods when documents were submitted to show my payments during these XXXX omitted payment periods and my entire 20 years straight employment? The system erased ( skipped, omitted, ignored ) months and years of employment that would have counted towards my forgiveness. I am a very logical person and if something doesn't make sense to me, it seems deliberate... thus faulty. Can somebody please provide a logical reason why the system or perhaps someone would omit my records? It seems like the system was made to only count some employment/ payments to show progress towards forgiveness but deliberately omitted several years of employment and payments to not grant full forgiveness. Therefore, I ask again, can a real person please provide a logical reason to at least alleviate my suspicion of a faulty system. Again, please make it make sense. Thank you kindly. 

I submitted another suspicious activity case to be informed of any reason ( s ) to why the system would erase, omit, skip years of my qualified employment that I sent proof of in order to adversely deem me XXXX payments short of the required XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. 

In several phone calls and in the below response from XXXX, the agents kept mentioning I was in XXXX in which just continually confused me. I remained steadfast that I never requested for an XXXX  during the omitted period. I knew a deferment meant you needed your payments halted because of trouble paying, but I was still making payments during the periods in question. So why did that apply to me? Nobody explained the ramification of an XXXX  status on your record, they just kept mentioning it and I just kept denying it. 

XXXX response : Thank you for contacting XXXX, We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. Your account after having XXXX reviews submitted regarding missing months is correctly showing XXXX/XXXX payments for your approved employment at XXXX from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX. 

According to your underlying loan information on www.nslds.ed.gov, your loans were placed into an In-School Deferment XX/XX/XXXX and did not enter repayment until XX/XX/XXXX. You also show forbearance periods which were not XXXX consecutive or XXXX cumulative months that did not qualifying on the underlying loans within your consolidation loan. 

I had enough and decided to investigate myself the background to having XXXX on your record. 

After my investigation, I submitted another case to XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I typed : To whom it may concern, I received a response from my inquiry regarding several months/years and thus payments not being counted towards my limited PSLF. I still say ''limited '' because I did get in all of the requirements to qualify under the limited stipulations before it expired. The response mentioned an "" in-school deferment '' that shows on my record. I have been very confused about this status showing up on my record until I looked deeper into this topic. Through a XXXX search, it is NOW to my knowledge that the XXXX  is AUTOMATICALLY placed on a student 's account when they enter school. I knew without a doubt that I did not ask for this XXXX. You folks had me thinking I was crazy. Furthermore, I had to run across a reddit post that was posted 2 years ago that informed me of a so-called XXXX  waiver form. The post included a link to the form at ( XXXX ) which of course could not be attained. Even the person who made the post acknowledged that the form was extremely cumbersome to track down. Why is this? My guess is that these loan companies do not want students to fill and send in this form, because you know the continued payments would not count towards loan forgiveness. And that is why the XXXX is automatically placed on student 's account so we wouldn't know. I apologize if my speculation is incorrect, but I am mad and I smell a rat. To my knowledge, XXXX is a temporary postponement of repayment of federal student loans. If I was aware of this XXXX, that means I would have requested it and if I had requested it, that means I knew I wouldn't have been able to make the payments. And if I wouldn't have been able to make payments, why did I continue to pay and paid {$12000.00} during this XXXX  period. I did not ask for this and I was not notified of a waiver form that could have been filled out so that any continued payments would count towards student loan forgiveness. This is pure deception. It is financial XXXX. My student loan forgiveness count has suffered due to something I did not ask for or wasn't told that there was a waiver form to submit in order to not be in XXXX  when I pursued my master. When I went back to school I did not look to or depend on federal student loans to finance my master. I was determined not to accrue any further student loans. There is no record of me borrowing money from the federal government during that XXXX  period because I was doing this ALL on my own. I had no communication with Navient or any federal government to aid me or halt my payments. All I wanted was to enroll in school, continue to make payments on my existing loan, graduate and finish on my own. I did not ask for the federal government help in halting my payments in order for me to do what I had set my mind to do. I should have been offered the help without the automatic assumption that I needed the aid. This XXXX  was done behind my back and now I am paying for it just as if an innocent XXXX victim would suffer if a XXXX  XXXX was contracted by no fault of their own. Now I am sorry I had to go to such extreme, but that is the only way for me to explain how I feel. This unknowingly XXXX period includes XXXX payments that are not being counted and should be. This is pure deception and so not fair. Every single analyst I have spoken to/ emailed regarding my concerns of my missing payments not being counted never mentioned the XXXX  being automatic or a waiver form existed. They just kept throwing this XXXX  in my face, keeping me confused, and never took into account all the payments I made during this XXXX  period. Don't you think I would want {$12000.00} to count? I continued to pay and that is proof I DID NOT know I was in XXXX and thus my payments were being disqualified. Those XXXX payments were deceptively uncounted for and need to be. 

XXXX 's Response : Thank you for contacting XXXX, You may submit a reconsideration request through https : //studentaid.gov/manage-loans/pslf-reconsideration. Conducting a thorough review of each submission may take some time, depending on how much information there is to consider, among other factors. Once FSA completes the review of a request for reconsideration, FSA will notify you of the outcome of the review. 

Thank you, XXXX I immediately proceeded with submitting a reconsideration form. I included pretty much all the above. 

In the meantime, I received a letter on XX/XX/XXXX that XXXX was now my new servicer. 

I was thinking, great, now I will have to go through all of this explaining once again. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, FSA replied : Dear ****, Thank you for submitting a Public Service Loan Forgiveness Reconsideration request. Your case number is # XXXX. 
Please retain this number for reference. 
Because of the number of requests, reconsideration reviews may take some time. We will provide the status or results of your reconsideration request via email, and thank you for your patience. 

I waited a long time and never heard back and submitted a second reconsideration request, case # XXXX. 

I received a response that no requests were being investigated until after XXXX. So I waited and gave it past XXXX before seeking a response. Before I could look back into the case, on XX/XX/XXXX, I was sent the below from FSA. 

Dear ***, Thank you for contacting the U.S. Department of Educations office of Federal Student Aid. Your case number is XXXX. Please retain this number for reference. 

We received a request for Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) reconsideration. The request is under review. However, because of the number of requests, reconsideration reviews may take some time. We will provide the status or results of your PSLF reconsideration request via email. We thank you for your patience. 


We hope this information is most helpful as your case is now closed. If you have additional questions, please contact us at XXXX during regular hours of operation : XXXX, XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX ; XXXX  and XXXX, XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX. ; and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX Eastern Standard Time. We are closed XXXX and XXXX. 
Sincerely, Federal Student Aid Please note how they said my request was under review and how it would take some time followed by my case was now closed all in the same email. How suspicious is that? I feel as if they didnt even look into my case and sent a generic email to wipe their hands clean of this deception. 

Then XXXX days later on XX/XX/XXXX, FSA sent the following regarding my initial reconsideration request : Dear ***, Thank you for submitting a Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) and Temporary Expanded PSLF ( TEPSLF ) Reconsideration request. Your case number is # XXXX. Retain this number for reference. 

We have completed our review of your reconsideration request. 
Based on the information provided and our research, we did not process your request because your request is not permitted under the PSLF Program. 

This reconsideration review is closed. 

If you need more help or have any questions, contact us Sincerely, Federal Student Aid These responses were so close, back to back, that it makes me feel like they are just cleaning out the queue by just dismissing my logical complaint. 

I immediately submitted another case # XXXX. 
Date Submitted XX/XX/XXXX I was sent a very quick seemingly generic response back about a very heartfelt and logical case regarding TEPSLF Reconsideration. I feel like this was just a blast rebuttal email sent out to everybody just to get cases closed. If one truly took their time to look into my case, one would truly see how I was frauded and the years of repayment I made should be reconsidered. I know for a fact I thought I was doing the right thing by making my monthly payments to repay my debt. Should I have just not made them? Do you not want to be repaid? I paid over {$12000.00} that is not being counted. My case was closed with the simple excuse of "" we did not process your request because your request is not permitted under the PSLF Program. '' Can you please explain why it's not permitted? My request was very permitted. I did right everything that I was supposed to do. This is the same general run around I have been receiving from every company dealing with this loan. Can somebody please actually look into this and give me a logical reason why my {$12000.00} isn't being reconsidered?

I was pressured by recruiters from the XXXX XXXX at the time to take out private loans as my only option to fund my education, and was ensured by them that I would have no problem finding a job after this in order to pay for my education. I soon learned this was far from the truth. 

Like many others who went to this sham school, I had great difficulty in finding employment after graduation and as a result, had a very difficult time making the high student loan payments to pay for my education. I defaulted on XXXX of my loans shortly after I graduated due to lack of gainful employment. I had to survive financially off of credit cards and personal loans in order to get by, and I am still trying to dig myself out of this financial hole to this day- along with trying to pay down the balance of my Navient private loans. I owe MORE now than I did when I took the loans out, almost XXXX  years later. 

At XXXX XXXX XXXX, I have not been able to save for retirement or contribute to a college fund for my XXXX young boys. I hate to think that they are paying the repercussions that came from me falling for the XXXX XXXX scam when I was a young adult, but it is hard not to see it that way. 

I have applied once for the XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX of XXXX and was denied- with only a vague response from Navient, stating that "" Navient carefully considers a variety of factors in determining whether a private loan should be XXXX based on school misconduct and you do not meet the requirements for discharge based on misconduct by your school. '' How did I not meet requirements? I documented the great financial harm I have suffered from this, I went to a school that has been proven to have engaged in deceptive recruitment and predatory lending practices and has since been shut down, and I have been included in the XXXX XXXX 's blanket discharge of loans related to this school ( although this did not help me because my loans are private ). I meticulously put together a binder of evidence, including screenshots of the inflated job placement statistics and "" average '' salaries for those graduating from AIM, screenshots of countless rejection letters from jobs I applied to and emails I sent in the years after graduation seeking assistance in finding a job, and emails that were left unresponded to by career counselors that PROMISED to help me find a position after graduation. 

I was lied to about the merits of this education, was pressured into taking out {$80000.00} in private loans at the time that I signed up for the program ( which, by the way, I was told I had to sign the same day that I met with recruiters ), and over XXXX  years later am still deep in debt from this experience. I do not have family to help me out financially, as my wife and I are both from low-income backgrounds- something I have now learned was part of the recruitment tactic of AIM, to target those from similar backgrounds with promises of a great, high-paying career. 

These loans should be forgiven due to the misconduct that XXXX took in recruiting myself and others, as well as the pressure they placed on myself to take out private loans for this sham degree. I am attaching a letter that XXXX XXXX XXXX wrote last month, echoing much of what I have said above.

07/30/24,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"Subject : Complaint Against Navient Corporation and Navient Solutions , LLC for FTC Federal Violation 16 C.F.R. 433.2 Missing from For-Profit Private School Loans Dear CFPB and FTC, I am writing to formally report violations of FTC Federal Regulation 16 C.F.R. 433.2 by Navient Corporation and Navient Solutions , LLC on three separate occasions. 

On XX/XX/year>, I received a School Misconduct Private Loan Discharge Application ( EXHIBIT A ). I completed this application, providing evidence of school misconduct along with federal violations committed by Sallie Mae, now operating as Navient Corporation and Navient Solutions , LLC . This completed application, along with the supporting evidence, was mailed on XX/XX/year>, with a return receipt. 

On XX/XX/year>, I received a notification through my Navient portal confirming receipt of my Private Loan School Misconduct Discharge Application ( EXHIBIT B ). On XX/XX/year>, I received a letter from Navient stating that my School Misconduct Discharge has been approved, and Navient has waived the remaining balances of my private student loans in the amount of {$16000.00} ( EXHIBIT C ). Enclosed with the letter was a check for {$630.00} ( EXHIBIT D ). 

However, Navient has, on three occasions, given, received, enforced, and accepted payments on private loan contracts where the Holder Rule was absent from the promissory notes for these three loans ( EXHIBIT E, pages 4, 5, 6 ). This constitutes a violation of federal law.

The Holder Rule, established by the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), requires that a specific notice be included in certain consumer credit contracts, including promissory notes for private student loans. ( EXHIBIT H ). This notice preserves the consumers right to raise claims and defenses against any holder of the loan that they could assert against the original creditor. If this rule is violated, it renders the contract unenforceable or provides the consumer grounds for seeking refunds of payments made under that contract. 

By approving my misconduct application, Navient has admitted that my school engaged in misconduct. However, the check issued to me, covering payments made only since XXXX, is grossly inadequate. I have not cashed this check, as I do not accept a mere {$630.00} after years of payments made on fraudulent contracts and a school proven to have engaged in misconduct. 

In my application, I outlined that Navient is in violation of federal law by accepting payments on three contracts that lack the Holder Rule, as required ( EXHIBIT F, pages 26, 27 ). Navient has had the opportunity to rectify this by issuing full restitution through my School Misconduct Discharge Application. I am entitled to a refund for all payments, including interest ( EXHIBIT G1 and EXHIBIT G2 ), on these three loan contracts that violate federal law. 

Unlike federal student loans, each private student loan contract requires a corresponding promissory note. There is no statute of limitations on the Holder Rule ( EXHIBIT H ). Each violation is subject to a {$50000.00} fine by the FTC. Even if a loan has been paid off but the promissory note did not include the Holder Rule, the contract is unenforceable. 

I am entitled to recover the payments I have made. I have included my application outlining proof of these violations, along with the contracts and promissory notes, for your review. Navient is not entitled to state that their decision on payments is proprietary, especially concerning impactful decisions related to federal violations and individuals ' financial well-being. 

I request your assistance in addressing this matter and ensuring that Navient complies with federal regulations. I seek a full refund of all payments made on these loans, along with the applicable interest, and enforcement of the fines for these violations.

06/06/24,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"To Whom It May Concern : I am writing to file a formal complaint against Navient for its refusal to refund all payments made on my private loans, which were taken out to attend a for-profit educational institution, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX that XXXX XXXX misconduct. Despite Navients acknowledgment of this misconduct, I have only been refunded a single month of payments. This response is not only inadequate but also in clear violation of the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) Holder Rule, as explicitly stated in my promissory notes.

Relevant Facts : 1. Promissory Note Terms : My promissory notes contain the following notice : I understand that the following notice is only applicable to loans issued to finance educational expenses at for-profit educational institutions or institutions otherwise subject to the FTC Holder Rule under 16 C.F.R. 433.2. 
NOTICE : ANY HOLDER OF THIS CONSUMER CREDIT CONTRACT IS SUBJECT TO ALL CLAIMS AND DEFENSES WHICH THE DEBTOR COULD ASSERT AGAINST THE SELLER OF GOODS OR SERVICES OBTAINED WITH THE PROCEEDS HEREOF. RECOVERY HEREUNDER BY THE DEBTOR SHALL NOT EXCEED AMOUNTS PAID BY THE DEBTOR HEREUNDER. 


2. Navients Acknowledgment of School Misconduct : My application for a school misconduct discharge was approved by Navient, indicating their acknowledgment that the school engaged in fraudulent activities. 

XXXX. Navients Awareness Since XXXX : Inquiries to Navient about the limited refund led to the revelation that Navient has been documenting complaints related to school misconduct since at least XXXX, demonstrating their long-standing awareness of the issue. 

XXXX. Extensive Payments Made : I have been making payments on these loans since XXXX and have paid double the amounts owed in interest alone, amounting to substantial financial harm. 

XXXX. Repeated Appeals for Fair Treatment : Over numerous phone calls, I have expressed the inherent unfairness of repaying loans tied to a fraudulent institution. Had Navient listened to every phone call I ever made, they would see that I mentioned the misconduct of my school well before receiving the application from them in XX/XX/XXXX. Despite these appeals, and my request for a closed school discharge application ( which Navient no longer offers ), my concerns have been dismissed or inadequately addressed. It is unfair for Navient to put the ownus on the borrower, when they have always made it explicitly clear, no matter what argument we had, that the only way out of a private loan was death or XXXX. 

Complaint : XXXX refusal to refund the full amount of payments made on these loans is a blatant disregard of the protections afforded to me under the FTC Holder Rule, as noted in the terms of my promissory note. By approving my school misconduct discharge application, Navient has implicitly acknowledged the fraudulent nature of the educational institution and, therefore, my entitlement to a full refund of all payments made under the compromised loan agreement. 

Furthermore, I would like to highlight that Navients recent Attorney General settlement included provisions for refunding borrowers under similar circumstances involving school misconduct, particularly for loans that had been in default. This settlement underscores Navients recognition of their responsibility to remedy financial harm caused by fraudulent educational institutions. However, in my case, despite my loans not being in default, Navient has unjustly refused to refund the payments I made. The inconsistency in their actions between the settlement agreement and my situation is both unjust and indefensible, demanding immediate correction. 


Demand for Resolution I demand that Navient : 1. Refund the full amount of all payments made towards these loans, including principal and interest, in accordance with the FTC Holder Rule.

2. Provide a detailed accounting of all payments made and the specific reasons for their refusal to issue a full refund.

Failure to address these issues adequately will leave me no choice but to escalate my complaint to additional regulatory bodies, including the New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs and the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance, and to seek legal recourse to recover the funds wrongfully retained by Navient. 

Conclusion The ongoing financial and emotional distress caused by Navients actions is unacceptable and must be rectified immediately. Why does Navient have borrowers outline in a 14page application, the financial and emotional harm they have suffered paying these loans, only to refuse refunds.

I expect a prompt and comprehensive response to this complaint, detailing the steps Navient will take to comply with its legal obligations under the FTC Holder Rule.",None,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",NJ,080XX,None,Consent provided,Web,06/06/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,9193662

Not only was another XXXX my loans from Navient, from the same school and same XXXX XXXX, part of the XXXX settlement, I provided email evidence of how the school presented XXXX XXXX as the preferred lender to their students when applying for financial aid through the XXXX XXXX employees. 

I do not see how my loan would qualify for the XXXX settlement, and this one not be granted relief through borrower defense. 

The only reason this loan was not part of the XXXX settlement is because I had a co-signor and based on the XXXX terms, my loan did not qualify due to the CO-SIGNORS XXXX XXXX. However, Navient allowed the CO-Signor to be waived by paying $ XXXX towards this loan to have his name removed from the loan. Navient made this decision despite the proof of income I showed as a single mother. 

So, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX allowed a loan to be taken out only because of a co-signor, and because of that co-signor the loan was not part of the XXXX XXXX, but not the co-signor is removed, which was the only reason it did not qualify for the settlement. Because all other claims in that lawsuit were for preferred lender status and giving our subprime loans knowing the borrowers could not afford to repay those loans. 

If my borrower defense application is being denied solely because the co-signor just paid $ XXXX and they would need to return those funds, I am asking for an investigation.",None,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",TN,37064,None,Consent provided,Web,08/04/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,9704561

This was after I filed for bankruptcy protection after a long bout of no and underemployment. Having paid Navient for a year and a half after bankruptcy until I ran out of money and was no longer able to pay. I have been dragged into court enough that I learned how to write legal responses because I couldnt afford an attorneys help after a time. Fast forward 6 years from when my payments were unable to be continued, I have continued to get judgement liens and so much legal paperwork that it is over a foot high. I have diligently worked for the last 2 years, saving, finally getting XXXX XXXX after a long bout of under and no employment. After adverse action was taken against me, I reached out to my lender with a settlement offer of {$20000.00}. This was after the attorney told me settlement was not possible, after first choosing not to respond to me ( Please see exhibit A & 1 ). P.S. I dont ever remember signing an agreement. It was a XXXX  time in my life having lost both incomes, my having to file bankruptcy & it being discharged. I had no job, & not even {$50.00} in the bank & writing my own legal responses. My settlement offer was accepted ( XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX ). The lender then called the debt attorney to notify them that my settlement offer had been accepted. ( Please see Exhibit XXXX where the email states that Navient would reach out to the attorney notifying them of acceptance of the offer. ) I was called by Navients attorney/representative ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX ). I missed the call. Called back and got the run around like I was running the XXXX m run at the Olympics. 

After not being able to get the lenders attorney to call back to settle, my attorney, XXXX XXXX, contacted Navient/SLM/Sallie Maes attorney for the update as to when the settlement paperwork would be sent so the payment could be made and the cases closed. Navients attorney told my attorney that we had to prove that their client accepted the offer. ( Please see Exhibit 3 where Attorney XXXX XXXX sent proof of acceptance of the settlement offer to NAVIENTs attorneys by XXXX XXXX, XXXX @ XXXX. ) After 5 days of no response, I and my attorney XXXX XXXX reached out by phone and email to Navients attorney ( Please see exhibit XXXX XX/XX/XXXX @ XXXX ). After multiple phone attempts and finally an email by my attorney XXXX ( See exhibit XXXX XX/XX/XXXX @ XXXX ), XXXX XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ) saying he was awaiting confirmation and clarification from their client concerning the resolution. Remind you, Navient contacted the law firm on XX/XX/XXXX and told them the offer was accepted. 

Fast forward to XX/XX/XXXX ( See Exhibit XXXX -email XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX ) Navients attorney XXXX XXXX XXXX sends an email to my attorney, XXXX XXXX XXXX and says that the client are not accepting the {$20000.00} and want {$39000.00}. They had agreed to the {$20000.00}. They waited until after the garnishments ran dry because my contract ended. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX told XXXX XXXX this when the initial settlement offer was made to them through my attorney XXXX XXXX ( See Exhibit XXXX ). I found out about the garnishment when I got my paycheck and it was short. I definitely would have tried to settle & seek representation if I was aware of a wage garnishment before it happening. ( See Exhibit XXXX & XXXX when I emailed my HR Dept inquiring about my income. ) The garnishment notice was sent to the company. ( See Exhibit 9 ) Now understand, this is not a case where I came or are coming empty handed. I have went through bankruptcy and had it discharged. Survived XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, where the XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I have survived a host of XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. Worked hard & diligent on trying to pay off everything & everybody I owed. I live frugally so I never have to file bankruptcy again. I finally got XXXX  XXXX  after a long time. XXXX ended. I made a settlement offer with NAVIENT. I had it accepted, then had it reneged upon. Then more court papers ( XXXX sent to my attorney XX/XX/XXXX ). THIS IS NOT RIGHT. 

Typically, when one goes through a bankruptcy discharge, this allows a person to move on and start afresh financially. Instead, I have been sued up the wazooie, & continued to be affected financially ( 8 years after insolvency ).

I am asking for your assistance to quell this matter. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ( I was underemployed. But it became rewarding work. ) from XXXX. During that time, I helped XXXX clients either obtain a modification to keep and stay in their home or transition respectfully. The thing about that process was there was an end. There has been no end to this process. I am asking for your help to settle this. This private student loan issue is akin to the Foreclosure XXXX XXXX that started in XXXX. It took up motion during the XXXX  XXXX. Started a fast walk/run pace during the Trump administration and is continually taking wings to soar on during the Biden administration . This is not going away. 

I ask your help because I have gone through this and had some assistance through my attorney. How many people is this happening to where NAVIENT is accepting, reneging, and continuing this unending vicious cycle? I know Im not the only one. I ask for your help. Im sure with your help and the help of our elected and appointed leaders, on the local, state and federal levels, XXXX can come. If XXXX can file bankruptcy on, by some accounts over {$3.00} XXXX dollars and walk away paying nothing, why cant I be allowed for my settlement offer be accepted and free to move on? Im not asking for a {$0.00} effort. Im asking for help in working with them to accept what they agreed to in writing, release me from all liens, and move forward.

Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system.

So whenever there is a violation under the FCRA, it impairs the efficiency of the banking system. This is a violation of TILA US Code 1666B since I was never late.

I recently reviewed my consumer report and noticed an incorrect late payment record on my NAVIENT XXXX. I have always maintained timely payments on this account. Under the Fair Credit Billing Act ( FCBA ) and the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ), creditors are required to accurately report consumer transactions and provide a mechanism for correcting errors in a timely manner. Please conduct an investigation into this matter, and if you can not provide documentary evidence of these supposed late payments, I demand these payments to be updated to on time as they should be as I was NEVER late. I expect these updates to be made promptly, in compliance with the law.

08/02/24,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"Dear NAVIENT, I am writing to formally address a serious violation concerning the unauthorized reporting of information to my credit report. This issue is in direct violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) under Sections 1681b ( a ) ( 2 ), 1681c ( a ) ( 2 ), and 1681s-2 ( a ), as well as the Texas Finance Code under Sections 392.301 and 392.305, and identity theft laws as outlined in the Texas Penal Code Section 32.51.

It has come to my attention that NAVIENT has engaged in unauthorized reporting to my credit report without my explicit consent. Under federal law, specifically the FCRA, consumer consent is a mandatory requirement for any credit reporting activities, as stated in Section 1681b ( a ) ( 2 ).

Moreover, Texas state law reinforces this requirement. Section 392.301 of the Texas Finance Code clearly states that consumer consent is necessary for credit reporting. Additionally, Section 392.305 provides guidelines for the fair reporting of consumer credit information. The identity theft laws, particularly Texas Penal Code Section 32.51, highlight the seriousness of unauthorized access and misuse of personal information. 

I unequivocally assert that I have not granted consent for NAVIENT to report any information to my credit report. This lack of explicit permission constitutes a clear violation of my rights, potentially damaging my creditworthiness and showing a blatant disregard for both federal and state laws. 

I demand that NAVIENT immediately cease any further reporting of information to my credit report without my explicit consent, as required by Section 1681b ( a ) ( 2 ) of the FCRA and Sections 392.301 and 392.305 of the Texas Finance Code. Should you fail to comply within the next 30 days, I will consider this willful noncompliance, which may result in penalties under applicable laws, including those related to identity theft. 

It is imperative to understand that obtaining consent is not optional ; it is a legal obligation under these specific sections of the FCRA, Texas state law, and identity theft laws. This is not a negotiation ; it is a demand for adherence to both federal and state regulations designed to protect consumers like myself from unauthorized and harmful credit reporting. 

I expect your immediate attention to this matter and anticipate that NAVIENT will rectify these violations promptly, respecting my rights under federal and state laws.

Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system. 

So whenever there is a violation under the FCRA, it impairs the efficiency of the banking system. This is a violation of TILA US Code 1666B since I was never late.

On the XXXX, 3 days after my final loan payment was done, I saw a lower amount was taken out than what it stated was for the total payoff amount, and that I had another auto payment scheduled for XXXX. It also showed that I had a balance of {$0.00} left on my act. So out of pure disbelief - I paid the remaining amount, {$0.00} from my bank act on the XXXX. Navient has since received my payments and shows both have posted to my act when I checked today, the XXXX of XXXX. But what really threw me for a loop was that the loan still showed open, still showed a scheduled autopay for XXXX, and still showed that the act was in repayment when in fact the act had been paid in full. Once the company receives the final payment, and post it to the act, how are they not closing the act or changing the status of the act to reflect the accurate status? The loan is no longer in repayment because it is paid off. 

I called a Navient and was told that they require that the acts show that they are still open and in repayment for 2 months after the last date of payment. WHAT!?!?!? That they need that time to season the payment?? How is this legal??? I have never had a lender keep the act open, and have it show an inaccurate payment status for 2 months after the date of the last payment??? Not only that but it was still reflecting as to have scheduled auto payments for the future! I was told from a customer service rep that they keep it open so they can adjust the act over two months? No. Once the payment has posted to the act, there is no reason to be adjusting anything. If there was an overpayment, then cut me a check but show the act is closed and its in good status! 

What really concerned me was the fact that they changed the auto payment amount to a lesser amount and then still showed I had a balance owed on the act!!?! How can that happen??!? I had to make an additional payment of {$0.00} on my act to pay it in full!!! This is not the only loan Ive had in my life but the most ridiculous loan Ive ever dealt with. If the payoff amount reflected the same amount that was owed, online- why would they change the amount of money they took for the payment that already showed it was pulling out the total amount shown under the payoff amount and then they change that as the payment is coming out so I still owed money on the act and they could still gain money from interest and missed payment fees on the act.

09/12/24,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) filed a proposed order against the student loan servicer Navient for its years of failures and lawbreaking. If entered by the court, the proposed order would permanently ban the company from servicing federal Direct Loans and would forbid the company from directly servicing or acquiring most loans under the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. These bans would largely remove Navient from a market where it, among other illegal actions, steered numerous student loan borrowers into costly repayment options. Navient also illegally deprived student borrowers of opportunities to enroll in more affordable income-driven repayment plans and forced them to pay much more than they should have. Under the terms of the order, Navient would have to pay a {$20.00} XXXX penalty and provide {$100.00} XXXX in redress for harmed borrowers. 

For years, XXXX top executives profited handsomely by exploiting students and taxpayers, said CFPB XXXX XXXX XXXX. By banning the notorious student loan giant from federal student loan servicing and ensuring the winddown of these operations, the CFPB will finally put an end to the years of abuse. 

I applaud the CFPB for obtaining concrete relief for borrowers and deterring similar failures in the future, said XXXX. Under Secretary of Education XXXX XXXX. XXXX action builds on the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX hold loan servicers accountable and protect borrowers, including more than XXXX XXXX borrowers who have received debt relief by fixing past failures to properly track progress toward forgiveness, such as correcting harms from forbearance steering. 

The CFPBs investigation of Navient kicked off a series of efforts by state and federal agencies to examine forbearance steering and other breakdowns in the income-driven repayment program. Those efforts have resulted in more than {$50.00} XXXX in debt relief for more than XXXX XXXX borrowers who were wrongly steered into forbearance, as well as those who had payments miscounted. Todays order complements actions already taken by the Department of Education and state attorneys general to provide redress to borrowers harmed by Navient.

The CFPB sued Navient for failing borrowers at every stage of repayment. The lawsuit alleges that Navient steered borrowers who may have qualified for income-driven repayment plans into forbearance instead. This practice was cheaper and simpler for Navient, but detrimental to borrowers. By steering struggling borrowers into forbearance where interest continues to accrue and capitalize Navients illegal actions led numerous borrowers to pay additional interest charges. 

Navient is a repeat offender with a long history of regulatory violations. After a referral from the CFPB, in XXXX, the Department of Justice and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ordered Navient and its predecessor, XXXX XXXX, to pay almost {$100.00} XXXX for illegally overcharging nearly XXXX service tomembers. In XXXX, the Department of Education ordered Navient to return more than {$22.00} XXXX in overcharges. In XXXX, XXXX state attorneys general announced a {$1.00} XXXX settlement with Navient for originating predatory student loans in addition to its forbearance steering practices.",None,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",LA,700XX,None,Consent provided,Web,09/12/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,10098136

My Federal Student Loans are in the process of being forgiven through the Borrower Defense to Repayment, due to widespread misconduct from the school I attended-XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX. There have already been several settlements from Navient for widespread, unfair and deceptive student loan servicing practices and abuses in originating predatory student loans for profit schools, such as XXXX XXXX XXXX. I faxed my XXXX XXXX XXXX to Navient XX/XX/XXXX, then, sent by certified mail XX/XX/XXXX. Navient received and confirmed receipt of application XX/XX/XXXX. I was waiting for a decision on the XXXX Private Signature Loans that Navient said I qualified for an application and was full aware that it could take up to 60 days as Navient stated on the misconduct application. 
I opened another complaint- complaint number : XXXX for the XXXX other Private loan called XXXX XXXX XXXX, all private loans held with Navient I have been paying and having issues paying since XXXX to date I owe roughly {$60000.00} ( more than the actual cost of the program ) with inflated interest in Private loan debt, since graduation with a useless degree ( a total of 4 private loans, 3 signature and 1 tuition answer loan ) all of which were used to fund my XXXX  XXXXXXXX XXXX and all have the holder rule disclosure attached to the loan paperwork. 
My misconduct application for loan discharge for XXXX signature private loans were held for XXXX XXXX and ended up being "" Denied XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  days after filing the other complaint to receive another school misconduct application for the private tuition answer loan. I was fully aware what Navient stated on the misconduct application that a decision could take up to 60 days. I filed a complaint-number XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX did not respond to this complaint until XX/XX/XXXX, denied misconduct discharge XX/XX/XXXX, my only intent was to recieve application approval for the tuition answer loan only since I had approval for three of my signature loans it was not intended to rush Navient in making a decision on my Signature Loans like they assumed in their response to this complaint. Navient also stated : they understand I wanted to include the XXXX XXXX XXXX with the three Signature Loans already in progress. I did not ask and never asked Navient to do such. This is another dishonest action from Navient to keep frauded student loan borrowers stuck-indebted to them. 
I was provided with the following reason for denial of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX loan discharge : Navient carefully considers a variety of factors in determining whether a private loan should be discharged based on school misconduct and you do not meet the requirements for discharge on misconduct by your school. There is no actual reason for the denial given and maybe the decision was coupled with retaliation by filing another complaint for the tuition answer loan held with XXXX XXXX XXXX again, a dishonest unjust decision. I sent Navient overwhelming amounts of evidence against XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX misconduct and Navient XXXX to these loans : original school marketing material, lack of career services, falsified jobs rates after graduation, enrollment agreements, selective admission process/lack of, overall cost of program, job placement rates, abundance of articles on defraud and misleading practices, demand for graduates in my field, lost accreditation, FTC holder rule for private loan misconduct, high debt, promised earnings after graduation, abundance of harm these loans caused, Federal court letters, AG letters, letters from the education department, class action settlement, career and earning prospects, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX abundance of lawsuits class/private against XXXX who operate the chain of XXXX XXXXXXXX, Congress and Supreme court decisions , lost of financial aid if I did not make instant decisions, pressure to make large amount of loan decisions right away, etc, ....

09/12/24,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Struggling to repay your loan,Problem lowering your monthly payments,"On XX/XX/XXXX I sent this letter to Navient : I was going over the numbers on my student loan that I have with NAVIENT, and I was astounded by the amount of money that I have paid in going to my principal vs the money going to the interest. I have been making payments since XXXX ( XXXX  years ) and have paid a total of {$31000.00}. My original amount that was disbursed was {$27000.00}, I am still showing a balance of {$21000.00} and my student loan will not be paid off until XXXX. 

Below are all the numbers that I have laid out : - Disbursement of student loan on XX/XX/XXXX was {$27000.00}. 

- As of XX/XX/XXXX, the total current student loan balance is {$21000.00}. 

- As of XX/XX/XXXX, I have paid {$31000.00} towards my student loans. 

- Loan interest is XXXX XXXX. 

- From the disbursement of the student loan to the current student loan balance it shows that I have paid {$5100.00} towards the principal. 

From my records that I pulled from NAVIENT, I have paid NAVIENT {$31000.00} since XXXX and my balance has only gone down {$5100.00} ( principal ). That being said, {$31000.00} - {$5100.00} = {$26000.00}, this has been how much interest I have paid towards the loan since XXXX. To date I have paid {$26000.00} just in interest! Thats insane considering my original loan amount was {$27000.00}! 

Could someone please tell me how this is acceptable? Its no wonder why the middle class can not get ahead. With these numbers, I can see why people are asking for student loan forgiveness. 

Im just looking for answers and help. I tried the income driven side of this and was told we make too much money. With inflation on everything, I know for a fact we dont make enough money. Please give me an explanation for this as I am just astonished by how much interest has been paid to date. 
________________________________________________________________ Navient 's response was that I was not eligible for an income-based repayment plan and that I had a promissory note to go by and that since the loans were consolidated the terms changed and I forfeited any benefits from the existing loan. 
________________________________________________________________ My issue is that I have been paying this student loan for a long time now and the balance isn't going down. I consolidated the loan because I was told that was the best course of action for me, that was a lie and lead to forfeiting any benefits I had with my prior loan ( s ). Also, they told me my best bet was to go into forbearance or deferment if I could not make the payments. I did so because they suggested that, and I assumed that I was being lead in the right direction. Navient has been nothing but hard to deal with and it seems like I've not been lead in the right direction. Even when it came down to me trying to lower my monthly payment, they stated I made too much money and didn't qualify, they acted like they didn't want to deal with me. So, at this point since I've tried working with NAVIENT and have gotten nowhere and I've made over {$31000.00} in payments, I feel like I should have the balance forgiven. 

I started with a {$27000.00} student loan, I've paid {$31000.00} back and still owe {$21000.00}. With some forbearance/deferments in there I've been paying on it for roughly XXXX years and have only managed to knock off roughly {$5100.00} off the principal. I find that to be ridiculous.

07/14/24,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Need information about your loan balance or loan terms,"In conjunction with a previous complaint filed regarding Navients high-default rate predatory loans and XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX misconduct ( CFPB complaint XXXX ), I would like to submit an additional complaint asking for my School Misconduct Application to be reassessed. ( THIS IS NOT A DUPLICATE COMPLAINT ) On XX/XX/XXXX Navient provided a School Misconduct Discharge application to my account inbox indicating that I could be eligible for discharge on applicable loans. I filled out the XXXX XXXX XXXX application and submitted it to XXXX XXXX XXXX  on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received both an email confirmation and a Navient Inbox message stating that my School Misconduct Discharge application was received by Navient. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received both an email confirmation and a Navient Inbox message with a letter stating that my School Misconduct Discharge application was denied. The letter stated that my applicable private student loans are not eligible for discharge due to the following reason ( s ) : Navient carefully considers a variety of factors in determining whether a private loan should be XXXX based on school misconduct and you do not meet the requirements for discharge based on misconduct by your school. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent an email to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX requesting a detailed explanation of how and why my application did not meet the requirements for discharge based on misconduct by my school. On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX of Navient sent a physical letter to my home address that included a generic, blanket response that they have sent to other XXXX XXXX XXXX who were denied as well. I believe XXXX decision to deny my School Misconduct Discharge application was an inaccurate and unfair response to my experience as a student at a scam school ( XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX ). 
I am aware of XXXX decision to settle for {$1.00} XXXX when sued by XXXX state AGs regarding their predatory loans to attend for-profit schools and that Sallie Mae/Navient were a "" preferred '' lending company in a "" deal '' with these schools during the early XXXX. These private loans with a high risk of default were part of a package deal offered to "" for profit online schools ''. But those who were not in default for 7 months or more during a "" specific '' time frame, like myself, were excluded from the settlement. Im also aware that XXXX XXXX XXXX  ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) was won by the Plaintiff in XXXX, XXXX where The XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) was recognized as a scam school by XXXX XXXX XXXX. Yes, the case is regarding federal student loans but I am referencing the acknowledgment of my school being a scam school and the loans they distributed ( which would include XXXX loans, of course ). Under the FTCs "" XXXX XXXX, predatory student loans in Navients portfolio are subject to claims and defenses based on well-established school misconduct and predatory lending. It appears Navient is refusing to grant discharge in order to keep people like myself who have paid the original principle 2 times over as passive income and let the people who refuse to pay anything go because Navient doesnt want to waste overhead chasing and begging defaulting borrowers to pay. In a letter to President & CEO of The Navient Corporation, XXXX XXXX acknowledged that on XX/XX/XXXX, Navient announced it will outsource the servicing of XXXX XXXX student loans to XXXX in the coming months. But a large portion of these loans are eligible for cancellation. Navient is aware that borrowers have meritorious defenses to the enforcement and collection of these loans, and has set aside at least {$35.00} XXXX in anticipation of claims or defenses being brought against Navient for misconduct. For borrowers like myself, Navient shouldnt have to set aside {$35.00} XXXX in anticipation for legal action as I have already paid the original principal 2 times over and my accumulative payments do not constitute a loss for the company. Accounts like mine who qualify for federal discharge and who have paid the original principle back 200 %, should be XXXX if this company had any integrity. At this point, its greed and avoiding unaccountability that is driving this company. These factors, along with other lawsuits against Navient makes me question the integrity and business practices of them and schools like the XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  for which they have done business with. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a Notice of Borrower Defense Discharge Approval from The United States Department of Education. The notice stated that The U.S. Department of Education ( ED ) has determined that the federal student loan ( XXXX ) you received to attend XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX on or after XXXX XXXX, XXXX, and on or before XXXX XXXX, XXXX, are eligible for a full discharge. This means the remaining balance on the eligible loan ( s ) will be forgiven. Your loan ( s ) will be discharged based on an XXXX finding that XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX made pervasive and widespread substantial misrepresentations that borrowers relied on to their detriment. The XXXX.S. Department of Educations criteria is in part based on my schools misconduct. This confirms XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX misconduct in relation to my experience. If The U.S. Department of Education was able to identify my schools misconduct and the impact it had on me as a borrower, I do not believe XXXX denial of my application is fair or moral. I believe XXXX criteria for XXXX XXXX XXXX approval needs to be evaluated and investigated for legitimacy. 

As of today, I have paid {$54000.00} on this loan. The principal amount on the loan was {$25000.00} and the current balance as of XX/XX/XXXX is {$35000.00}. After 12 years of paying the loan and not missing payments, I have paid the loan twice already. Navient has made it so that most of my payments only apply to the interest on the loan with {$0.00} being applied to my principal on over half of the loan payments. After capitalized interest-grace end and repayment fee, when the loan repayment period started in XX/XX/XXXX, the balance was {$36000.00}. For me to have paid {$54000.00} over a 12 year span and the principal balance to only go down {$1600.00} is a prime example of Navients plan to have borrowers like myself in debt forever. These predatory loan practices are a prime example of the schools misconduct as my for-profit school and Navient looked to have worked hand in hand to distribute these high-default rate predatory loans to student borrowers like myself.",None,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",DC,20001,None,Consent provided,Web,07/14/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,9507246

Sallie Mae knew that by setting very high interest rates ( typically in the range of XXXX percent ) on its high-interest private loans-often XXXX to XXXX times larger than on federal loans-it was significantly diminishing plaintiffs ' chances of fully repaying these loans. Sallie Mae further knew that this would likely result in significantly raising the plaintiff class 's high-interest private loan default rates relative to traditional student loan default rates. Sadly, this likelihood has been realized ; the putative class has defaulted at extraordinarily high rates. '' The school lured students with a string of false promises, the class claims. 
"" Among XXXX 's false and misleading representations were the following : ( a ) admission to XXXX was a competitive and selective process ; ( b ) a XXXX education increases graduates ' incomes and opportunities in the food-service industry to a degree that makes a XXXX  education well worth the sky-high tuition ( approximately {$48000.00} for the XXXX XXXX XXXX, {$28000.00} for the Baking and Pastry Program, and {$38000.00} for the Management Program ) and corresponding student-loan debt ; ( c ) XXXX  has an extensive network of contacts and close relationships with prestigious restaurants and other food-service employers where XXXX  graduates can easily obtain employment in one or more of the positions for which XXXX  promises to train them ; ( d ) XXXX  has an excellent reputation, and graduates will benefit from that reputation by being able to gain better and more prestigious jobs with a XXXX  degree than without one ; ( e ) XXXX  students have an extremely high rate of job placement in jobs for which the students seek to be trained ; and ( f ) the programs can be financed through student loans, with a resulting debt service burden that is reasonable and manageable in light of the income opportunities available to graduate, '' according to the complaint. 
Sallie Mae knowingly aided and abetted this fraud for its own profit, the complaint states : "" XXXX had an agreement with Sallie Mae to recommend Sallie Mae as a 'preferred lender ' to prospective students : Sallie Mae would provide these students high-interest private loans to pay the balance of their educational costs not covered by federal grants and loans. '' Sallie Mae conducted its own research and analysis of XXXX 's graduation rates and employment statistics of its graduates, so it knew what was going on, the class claims : "" Sallie Mae was acutely aware, by the time plaintiffs and class members sought loans to attend XXXX, that a XXXX education was not worth what it had been a decade prior, that a significant percentage of XXXX XXXX students were unemployed or making very low wages, and that XXXX students were financially unable to repay fully the high-interest private loans. '' XXXX of the XXXX lead plaintiffs are unemployed and all XXXX say they owe significantly more money on their loans than what they took out. 
Plaintiff XXXX XXXX claims he took out a {$45000.00} loan at XXXX percent interest. The balance has grown to {$140000.00}. He says he works as a line cook at a restaurant where he makes {$14.00} an hour. 
Plaintiff XXXX XXXX took out XXXX loans totaling {$16000.00} to finance her education at XXXX. She has already paid {$14000.00}, but with an interest rate of XXXX percent, her balance remains {$42000.00}, according to the lawsuit. 
"" XXXX XXXX 's only culinary-related employment since she graduated from XXXX was a XXXX-month job as a cashier in a corporate dining cafeteria, where she occasionally performed light preparation work in the kitchen, '' the complaint states. "" Her hourly wage was {$9.00}. She was unable to find any other culinary work after being laid off from this position, and she believes her XXXX credential actually hurt her culinary-job prospects. '' According to the complaint : "" The sad, true fact is that a XXXX education does not significantly increase graduates ' incomes and opportunities in the food-service industry. XXXX 's reputation has plummeted since the XXXX. Indeed, food-industry personnel and potential employers snicker that XXXX stands for XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX. ' '' While plaintiffs and the class are saddled with debts they can not repay, Sallie Mae has benefited in XXXX ways, the complaint states : "" First, Sallie Mae profited, and intended to profit, by inflating its balance sheet with billions of dollars of loans to plaintiffs and others at similar non-traditional schools. Sallie Mae 's scheme intentionally inflated its stock price and attracted potential acquirers. 
"" Second, because the high-interest private loans have such high interest and Sallie Mae 's own cost of funds is so low, Sallie Mae can profit even if the loans are never repaid fully. "" Sallie Mae 's cost of funds ( estimated at XXXX percent to XXXX percent ) is negligible compared to its high-interest private loans ' typical compound interest rates of XXXX percent. 
"" Third, because student loans generally are not dischargeable in bankruptcy, Sallie Mae can squeeze out small amounts of money from the student borrowers for the rest of their lives. Sallie Mae demands plaintiffs ' small paychecks, even when the payments do not cover the accumulating interest, allowing Sallie Mae to profit while the XXXX students ' high-interest private loan balances continue to increase. '' Sallie Mae has acknowledged that it knew the students would not be able to repay the loans, the class claims. 
"" Sallie Mae 's chairman acknowledged that these loans were 'predictably not collectible. ' He admitted that many students attending XXXX and other similarly valueless schools likely would never be able to earn sufficient income to repay in full the loans they were taking out, '' the complaint states. 
It adds : "" Ignoring the financial burden its actions placed on borrowers, Sallie Mae blithely extended loans it never expected to be repaid fully- all for the purpose of manipulating its financial reports and increasing its revenue. Sallie Mae was fully aware there was a reasonable likelihood that plaintiffs and class members would be unable to repay their high-interest private loans in full. Yet it intentionally failed to disclose this highly relevant information to plaintiffs and class members at the time that it issued their high-interest private loans. '' Sallie Mae owns the class members ' "" high-interest private loans under various names, '' the complaint states. It serviced the high-interest private loans under the name Sallie Mae XXXX XXXX XXXX which was a division of SLM until XXXX XXXX, XXXX, when Sallie Mae XXXX XXXX was merged into Sallie Mae XXXX , which took over the loan servicing.

My grandfather called Navient to see what needed to be done to have him removed as the cosigner on my loan and they told him that if the loan payment was made on time every month for 12 consecutive months that we could have him removed as the cosigner, so my grandparents, who were already retired and on a fixed income, set up autopay and began paying my loan on XX/XX/XXXX.

In conclusion, the forbearance ended without my knowledge, I was not making payments because I could not ascertain the amount I needed to pay and now my credit is destroyed because the record shows I have non-payment dates on my student loan accounts. Although I have sent numerous request via the credit bureaus to remove the non-payment and slow payment credit information, Navient has not. I explained to them that I was told that I was in a forbearance and did not have to make payments. At this point I do not know what to do to get this negative information removed from my credit file. Additionally, I believe this debt should have been forgiven as part of the school loan forgiveness program. Please assist me in dealing with Navient.

05/03/24,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Don't agree with the fees charged,"Dear Concerned Parties, I write to bring to light a matter of grave concern affecting thousands of students ensnared in the predatory lending practices of Navient, particularly those who, like myself, attended for-profit online institutions such as the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 

It is a stark reality that the XXXX XXXX, along with their parent company, XXXX, have been subjected to investigations by numerous state attorneys general, resulting in damning findings of fraudulent activities. 

Recently, in response to the egregious actions of institutions like the XXXX XXXX, the XXXX  administration has taken a commendable step by announcing a sweeping discharge of loans for individuals enrolled at these institutions between XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. This move offers a glimmer of hope for those burdened by the weight of unjust debt. 

As I await the impending discharge of my federal loans and the subsequent repair of my credit, I am compelled to address the insidious practices of Navient. Not only have I dutifully repaid a significant portion of my original loans, including interest in the amount of {$41000.00} in Federal loans and {$31000.00} in Private loans, but I also demand restitution for the predatory behavior exhibited by Navient. 

The symbiotic relationship between Navient and for-profit online schools, facilitated by preferential lending arrangements, is a stain on the integrity of the education finance system. It is evident that these loans, fraught with a high risk of default, were designed to exploit vulnerable students, leaving many in financial ruin. 

Navient 's track record of malfeasance extends beyond its collusion with for-profit institutions. The company has faced legal action from state attorneys general, allegations of deceptive loan practices, and accusations of illegal collection methods. Their recent attempts to absolve themselves of responsibility through superficial "" pilot programs '' are a slap in the face to those who have suffered at their hands. 

Under the FTC "" Holder Rule, '' Navient bears accountability for its role in perpetuating predatory lending practices, particularly in conjunction with online for-profit schools. Time is of the essence for Navient to rectify the injustices inflicted upon students who were lured into a web of deceit and financial exploitation. 

The call to action has been sounded by esteemed voices such as XXXX XXXX XXXX, who rightfully demands immediate discharge of these predatory loans. It is incumbent upon Navient to heed this clarion call and take swift and decisive action to alleviate the burdens of those they have wronged. This should also include refunds for payments made on these predatory loans. 

In conclusion, I implore all stakeholders to recognize the urgency of this matter and to stand in solidarity with those seeking redress. The time for accountability and restitution is now.

During the admissions process, it was determined that I did not qualify for federal student loans due to family income levels. The school recommended that I take out private student loans with a company they had a relationship with which would cease servicing XXXX students soon. I learned in XXXX that the reason for this is that XXXX had legal and financial troubles that threatened its accreditation. In my sophomore, junior and senior years XXXX recommended that I and a co-signer apply for private student loans through Sallie Mae which later were transferred to Navient. I was warned during these periods that if I failed to promptly get a private loan or find some other way to pay for enrollment, that I would be kicked out of classes and my credits would not be able to transfer to other colleges including credits for XXXX courses I had already completed. During every enrollment period I was strongly encouraged by the school to take out private student loans to attend either directly or by being threatened that I would be removed and my credits would not be transferrable to continue my education elsewhere.

When I attempted to use the job placement assistance programs, the information provided was almost universally out of date, incorrect, or pointed students to the wrong points of contact. Myself and the majority of other graduating students in my class had extreme difficulty finding employment within our fields, and nearly all graduating students in my class did not find stable permanent employment until we stopped searching for jobs relevant to our specific degrees such as public service sector and retail work. 

The records I have show that between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX I paid approximately {$45000.00} to Navient and Sallie Mae to attend a school that used high pressure tactics, deceptive advertising, and changed service expectations to deceive students into overpaying for limited services. I refinanced my student loans in XXXX and still owed over {$65000.00} in principal.

09/16/24,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"I have been paying on this loan for what seems like forever and I decided to perform research to see what the issue is and why my balance doesnt seem to be reducing. I began repaying this loan on XX/XX/XXXX and then took several iterations of forbearance periods due to school enrollments. 

Recently, I noticed that sometimes more than half of my payment is used to pay interest, which is REDICULOUS! After searching for payment allocations for Navients private student loans, I stumbled upon the Navient AG Multi-State Settlement of XXXX. To my surprise, I actually believe my loan was eligible for debt cancellation and I never received any notification or the actual cancellation!

Heres the criteria for the private student loan debt cancellation and restitution and my loan details are in parenthesis : The private loan debt relief will primarily go to borrowers who took out private subprime student loans ( made to borrowers with low credit scores ) through Navients predecessor, Sallie Mae, between XXXX and XXXX, and then had more than seven consecutive months of delinquent payments prior to XX/XX/XXXX. 

( this is me ; loan disbursement says XXXX in the system but I see disbursements from XXXX and there have been XXXX consecutive late payments- XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX ) The debt relief also includes certain other, non-subprime private student loans made by Sallie Mae Bank and certain other lenders between XXXX and XXXX for borrowers to attend specific for-profit schools that have been subject to state or federal law enforcement actions. A list of these for-profit schools is shown in the table below. 
o In many cases, large numbers of federal borrowers who attended these schools have sought cancellation of their federal student loans by filing Borrower Defense to Loan Repayment Applications alleging school misconduct. 

( My school was on this list XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ; my Borrower Defense to Loan Repayment Application was approved for my federal loans and they were discharged ) Generally, to be eligible for private loan debt relief, the borrower must have fallen behind on payments by more than seven months at some point before XX/XX/XXXX ( again, my XXXX consecutive late payments were assessed on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX. ) Generally, only loans that were within a statute of limitations period or still credit-reporting as of XX/XX/XXXX are within the scope of the debt relief ( XXXX STILL paying on this loan and it is still reporting ) To qualify for the Navient settlement, your mailing address on file with Navient as XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, must have been in XXXX of these states : Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia XXXX Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey XXXX New Mexico XXXX New York XXXX North Carolina XXXX Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island XXXX South Carolina XXXX Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia XXXX Washington, and Wisconsin. 

( I live in XXXX  and I have my whole life ) Now, Im not sure if I was inadvertently left out of the private loan discharge and restitution group, but I believe my case warrants a further look into what has been going on with my account. I have called multiple times over the last few years and I am tiredtired of the run around, the lack of sufficient documentation being sent after I request it and the lack of knowledge around what has happened with my account. 

I recently submitted the application for private student loan forgiveness for school misconduct on XX/XX/XXXX ; it was denied but I wasnt given a reason. Navient simply stated that they dont give reasons for denials but I can reapply using their archaic process. 

Long story short : I have paid a total of {$9900.00} on what seems to be a {$3100.00} loan that STILL has a {$2500.00} balance on it and isnt scheduled to be paid off until XX/XX/XXXX ( and I make more than the minimum payment as well ).

Unhelpful and XXXX XXXX : XXXX advised me to contact a law office or whoever else might hold my private loans, suggesting that Navient was not the holder of these loans. This is incorrect because Navient is indeed the holder of my private loans, and I was seeking their assistance directly. 

Lack of XXXX : The conversation left me without any resolution, further information, or steps to proceed with my request. This lack of assistance and inaccurate information has caused significant frustration and concern about my ability to address the loan cancellation process properly. 

Given that Navient is the holder of my private student loans, I expected the representative to provide clear guidance and support in navigating this situation, particularly given the complexities surrounding XXXX XXXX 's closure and the associated relief programs for the misconduct of XXXX.

I submitted additional evidence to the same email account with the hopes of improving the documentation on XX/XX/XXXX. This email was not responded to either automatically or otherwise. 

On XX/XX/year>, I received documentation from Navient stating that my application for school misconduct discharge was DENIED for the following reasons "" Navient carefully considers a variety of factors in determining whether a private loan should be discharged based on school misconduct and you do not meet the requirements for discharge based on misconduct by your school. '' I am currently attempting to gather more information and attempting to contact the advocate 's office to figure out whether or not I can appeal the decision, or if I can resubmit with evidence, but I haven't been able to find much more evidence.

Which I didnt know at the time that the agent didnt add all the loans to this program. This is where Navinet makes a lot of its money ( purposely misallocating payments, and leaving out loans to attach late fees ) Obscured information consumers need to maintain their lower payments. 

XX/XX/XXXX My cosigner then received a letter advising that my loans were in default and advised me. I promptly called and the agent XXXX advised that not all my loans were added, and some were in default. I then advised rep that I didnt realize that the previous agent left some of the loans out of the program for reduced payments, as doing some research online this is a common practice with Navinet . Each month a payment was auto deducted, yet they leave out loans purposely. Rep advised to make a payment of {$150.00} to keep my account out of collections and in the interim to complete my documents for my in-school deferment ( which I requested on this call ). 

XX/XX/XXXX I received a collections call advising that my account was in default and that I would need to make another payment of {$150.00}, however, I tried to explain to Navinet agent and urged her to read the call notes from the previous call to confirm payment to this week. She advised I needed to make another payment that would keep me out of collections and to submit my in-school deferment letter. She then pressured me to get that letter in, I advised rep that I just received the letter on XXXX and it was a holiday and to allow some time with the holiday. Navinet then proceeded to call and harass my cosigner with collection letters and calls. I tried to have my mother removed from my account, however, they deceived me about the requirements to release my mother as a co-signer. 

I have made payments to Navinet every month, yet Navinet practiced fraudulent tactics of leaving accounts out to incur late fees along with payment misallocation. I expect some level of competency with this business. I am fed up with the illegal tactics Navinet uses to drain money out of borrowers. I want a full audit of my account to possibly move forward with some legal recourse. This is ridiculous for these types of predatory lenders getting away with. Ive been paying my student loans for the past 20 years or so, however, I can not get ahead with the fraudulent tactics they do. Ive been told putting myself on auto pay would reduce my loan interest, each time Ive inquired about that, no agent can tell me anything.

The account is now closed due to loan consolidation. In XX/XX/year>, Navient submitted a 90-day late payment notice to all three credit reporting bureaus. To the best of my knowledge, the loan was on deferment for years because of difficulty paying. Yearly, I would call to request a deferment. To the best of my knowledge, the deferment was good for a year. So, it was a surprise when XXXX notified me of negative information on my credit file. I had no information from Navient that the deferment had expired. 

Upon learning of the negative information reported on my credit file, first, I reached out to Navient about the negative information they had reported and requested they remove it. Customer service informed me they couldn't remove the information, only the credit bureaus could do so. I argued that was incorrect. Navient provided the information, therefore, Navient could contact the credit bureaus to have it removed. She refused to honor my request. 

Then, I contacted XXXX on XXXX occasions to dispute the negative information. Each time, XXXX simply forwarded my dispute to Navient and that was it. It did not show how it conducted its investigation. I even submitted an email showing the account was on deferment, to no avail. I have not had any success dealing with either institution.

My details are as follows : I enrolled in XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) and transferred to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX and financed my education through private student loans serviced by Navient. Since completing my education, I have encountered numerous issues and concerns related to the loans and Navient 's practices, which I believe warrant investigation and action by your office. 

Specifically, my complaints against Navient include : 1. **Predatory Lending Practices** : The school misled students about the quality of education, career prospects upon graduation, and the true cost of attendance. The loans were granted without proper assessment of my ability to repay, and the interest rates were exorbitant. 

2. **Misleading Information** : Throughout my interactions with Navient, I have experienced instances of misleading or incomplete information regarding repayment options, interest rates, and eligibility for loan forgiveness programs.

3. **Servicing Issues** : Difficulty in accessing accurate loan information, frequent errors in billing statements, and challenges in receiving timely and accurate responses to inquiries or requests for assistance. 

4. **Lack of Support** : Despite attempting to work with Navient to explore repayment options or seek relief, I have encountered obstacles and a lack of proactive support in managing my student loan debt.

5. **Impact on Financial Well-being** : The financial burden imposed by these loans has had a significant and detrimental impact on my financial stability and overall well-being. 

Given the significant issues outlined above and the ongoing legal concerns related to the XXXX XXXX XXXX lawsuit involving similar predatory practices, I am requesting that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau thoroughly investigate Navient 's handling of private student loans associated with for-profit predatory schools. I also request that appropriate actions be taken to protect consumers like myself who have been adversely affected by these practices. 

I started my started my college education at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ), a predatory for-profit school in XX/XX/XXXX. I then transferred to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, another predatory for-profit school, in XX/XX/XXXX. Both of these schools are on the list of schools in the XXXX XXXX XXXX lawsuit.

According to my California XXXX XXXX XXXX paperwork, my loan was to cover XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. I have paperwork showing that I was enrolled in classes as of XX/XX/XXXX. To the best of my recollection, I remember going to classes in XX/XX/XXXX ; the instructor told us to come back in a few days. However, when we came back to the school everything was gone! The classrooms were locked and the few rooms that were opened were empty. We were told nothing, we didn't know where to get any information. At this point, I had to start working and without my diploma, I could not get paid for the "" training '' that I had studied for. Then I started getting the calls and letters to start making payments for the student loan that I had signed. I told them that I couldn't pay for services that were not rendered, I never received my diploma and then I was told that once I started making my payments I would receive my diploma so I started making payments. I never received the diploma and without that diploma, I couldn't get the higher money that I would receive if I had it. I have never been able to afford the payments. I even attempted bankruptcy and received a decision on XX/XX/XXXX to remove the student loan. It was only recently that I found the news article in the LA XXXX published on XX/XX/XXXX ( https : XXXX ). The school was already warned against getting student loans for students because the school had a high amount of students who were defaulting! The XXXX already knew that students could not pay back the loans that the school was pulling for these students. Other individuals had been going to the XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX attempting to get school records or start their classes and the campus was already closed.

I am sure this was a big win for Navient, but what a sham of a settlement deal for the rest of borrowers scammed into taking loans to at least XXXX for profit online schools.

Didn't Navient have to pay restitution to the Federal student loan borrowers for not informing students of IDR/IBR payments students could have enrolled in, but instead steered toward forbearance?

As a matter of fact, The XXXX XXXX of XXXX and XXXX was investigated by the numerous media sources. 
Because of the numerous class of fraud and misconduct perpetrated by these online for profit schools, such as The XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX, I was able to file a Borrower Defense claim with the Dept. of Education againstXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX, and my Fed. loans of $ XXXX were discharged and my credit repaired.

My Borrower Defense Claim was also part of the XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX settlement for which I was a full class member. 

I am aware that Navient was sued by 39 state AGs regarding their predatory loans to attend these online for-profit schools and that Sallie Mae/Navient were a "" preferred '' lending company in a "" deal '' with these schools during the early 2000 's. These private loans with a high risk of default were part of a package deal offered to "" for profit online schools ''. But loans made to students in states outside of the agreement, or those who were not in default for 7 months or more during a "" specific '' time frame, were excluded. I am sure this was a big win for Navient, but what a sham of a settlement deal for the rest of borrowers scammed into taking loans to at least XXXX for profit online schools. I was someone who would have qualified based on missing 7+ payments, being under qualified for the loan, meeting enrollment and foreberance requirements but because my loan was not charged off, as I began paying again, I was excluded. 

After the AG settlement, didn't Navient also get out of the Federal student loan business due to scrutiny from lawmakers and borrower advocates? Didn't Navient have to pay restitution to the Federal student loan borrowers for not informing students of IDR/IBR payments students could have enrolled in, but instead steered toward forbearance? Furthermore, hasn't Navient been sued at least a half dozen times for other predatory loan practices and illegal collection practices?

I am also aware of a "" pilot '' program by which Navient is sending out "" applications '' to select students who may have filed Borrower Defense claims against their schools and were approved. This application is a sham. Why do we need to prove anything? Navient knows who we are. Under the FTC "" Holder Rule '' Navient is liable for giving predatory loans in connection with online for-profit schools.

Repayment Periods : During certain periods, my loans were in repayment status without payments being made, leading to confusion and financial hardship. 

Default Period : Eventually, my loans entered default status and remained in default until they were consolidated and brought back into repayment status. 

Actions by the Company : The company repeatedly placed my loans in forbearance without adequately informing me of alternative repayment options such as IDR.

Impact : The frequent forbearance periods led to significant interest accrual and an increase in my loan balance.

06/29/24,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"I am trying to figure out why I am unable to reduce my balance or receive an opportunity to payoff at a reduced rate ( principle ) after so many years and multiple consolidations that were at the insistence of the company during the years I was having financial issues. My account was consolidated four times since XXXX each with a higher interest rate. 

In addition during the law suit I could not get any information but realized I had to make a payment or my interest was continuing to accrue. Nobody on the phone would explain to me why they couldn't talk to me and there was no information on the lawsuit available. 
"" As required by the order, communications regarding your account were temporarily suspended and your loan was placed in a forbearance status. Now that the court order has come to an end, your loan will enter back into repayment and regular servicing activity will soon resume. '' was in the XX/XX/XXXX letter. 

Now I am trying to find out how to pay off a reduced/reasonable amount to close this loan or have it forgiven ( my federal loans were reduced by PSLF and I might be eligible for this one now too- it's confusing with the new laws and lawsuits ) but I can't get any information from customer. My balance appears more than it should be given my payment history - due to interest. There are no running balance accounting available on the website. 

It appears given this excerpt from the letter that the money I paid every month was NOT applied to the principle and interest as requested on the website while my loan balance increased. I did NOT request to pay ahead- I expected to reduce the balance. "" Your private loan is paid ahead by approximately 15 months based on the additional funds received and the current Monthly Payment for this loan. '' Here is how the records show they applied the monthly payment but apparently this is not true : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX There can not be a prepayment and a reduction at the same time. I was expecting a reduction. 
The letter stating that I was going back into repayment indicates that overpayments ( if my amount due was XXXX then this should have been considered this category ) would reduce my loan. 
"" When you pay more than your Current Amount Due, Overpayments will be applied to your Current Balance. Unless you make your payments through Auto Pay or instruct us to do otherwise, Overpayments will reduce the amount of any future payments. For example, if you pay an extra {$50.00} and your regular Monthly Payment Amount is {$100.00}, your next payment due will be {$50.00}. If the extra funds are more than the next Monthly Payment Amount, your billing statements will show XXXX due. Interest continues to accrue on any loan until the loan has been paid in full, including loans with XXXX due. Even if you have a XXXXamount due on your billing statement, continuing to make payments will reduce your total costs of borrowing. '' If I don't continue to pay every month then the interest will continue to accrue. I might be willing to pay the principle ( maximum ) as a settlement but there is no place on the website see running balances to verify and validate what is happening with the money. Customer service will not discuss that option with me. 

My current payoff date is XXXX and that doesn't add up with the way money is allocated and my payment requirement. I would like this loan forgiven or the ability to pay off a nominal amount and the rest written off. I was able to do that 15 years ago on the other loan but didn't have the financial resources at the time to do both.

And also was sent a post from Attorney General that on XXXX XXXX there was a multistate settlement with Navient to resolve allegations of unfair and deceptive loan servicing practices, including steering federal loan borrowers into forbearances instead of counseling them about income-driven repayment ( IDR ) which I was a victim of, They also dismissed all the loans off many of my peers who to the same school who defaulted on their loans for same degree as mine and in the same time frame of XXXX to XXXX and had their loans dismissed in XXXX. These loans should be discharged and refunded and I should have been included. 

I am aware that Navient was sued by XXXX state AGs regarding their predatory loans to attend these online for-profit schools and that Sallie Mae/Navient were a "" preferred '' lending company in a "" deal '' with these schools during the early XXXX 's. These private loans with a high risk of default were part of a package deal offered to "" for profit online schools ''. But loans made to students in states outside of the agreement, or those who were not in default for XXXX months or more during a "" specific '' time frame, were excluded. I am sure this was a big win for Navient, but what a sham of a settlement deal for the rest of borrowers scammed into taking loans to at least XXXX for profit online schools.

Didn't Navient have to pay restitution to the Federal student loan borrowers for not informing students of IDR/IBR payments students could have enrolled in, but instead steered toward forbearance? Furthermore, hasn't Navient been sued at least a half dozen times for other predatory loan practices and illegal collection practices?

I transferred to XXXX from XXXX  XXXX XXXX and attended XXXX from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. I had to take out student loans in order to attend, and the only option I was given by the school 's financial aid reps, other than the federal loans that I qualified for, was to take out private loans from Sallie Mae. Not only was I told that there were no other options for private student loans, but scare tactics were used by the financial aid reps to get me to borrow more money than I actually needed. They said I needed more money for the specific class supplies because I could only use the supplies that the school 's bookstore sold, and those were inevitably more expensive than other places. They told me that with my class schedule and projects that would be required I wouldn't be able to work enough to pay my rent, bills, food, etc. I had attended XXXX for about a year and a half when, in XX/XX/XXXX, I was told by school personnel that XXXXXXXX XXXX accreditation was changing, and that I would have to start the fashion design program over if I wanted to graduate because the classes that I had already taken would not apply toward a degree with the new accreditation. I immediately chose to withdraw from XXXX, and since it was within the first week of the new quarter, I was able to cancel my loans for that particular quarter. However, I had thousands of dollars in federal and private student loans from the XXXX years that I was enrolled. At the time there were numerous students that were told the same thing about the accreditation changes, and they also withdrew from the school. I ultimately decided to re-enroll at XXXX XXXX XXXX in the fall of XXXX and despite XXXX 's promise that my credits would transfer, they did not. However, because I had been at XXXX XXXXXXXX before XXXX, and my advisor felt bad for what I had been through, she was willing to help me graduate as soon as I could. I graduated from XXXX with my XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. Unfortunately, almost 20 years later, I am STILL paying for the loans from my time at XXXX, and even though I have paid XXXX more than the original loan amounts, I somehow still owe them over {$42000.00}. I have asked Navient for my payment records from the time the loans originated to the present date, but they told me they can only provide limited information prior to the date that they took the loans over from Sallie Mae. They are only able to provide me with dates of transactions and the loan balances at the time of those transactions, but they are not able to provide me with the dollar amount of the transactions, or how my payments were applied to my balances ( how much went toward interest or principal ). I have spoken with several Navient reps who told me that they do not have that information, but Sallie Mae does. They advised me to call Sallie Mae. Unfortunately, when I called Sallie Mae I was told by numerous reps that they do not have a single record of my loans because Navient took ALL of the records when they took my loans over. I have heard about "" relief '' programs that Navient supposedly has for people whose loans were for schools that ended up being determined as fraudulent, but every time I have called Navient to ask about this I am given a different answer. I was laughed at by a rep who told me I "" don't have any options so just pay it. '' I called another day to ask about relief options and spoke with a woman who said that relief options are only available for people who were in school at the time the school closed due to fraud. I called and spoke with a rep very recently and asked how my payments were being applied, because my regular monthly payment was about {$590.00}, and I had paid almost {$2000.00} over the past 6 weeks but NONE of it was applied to my balance. The rep simply said that "" interest accrues daily. '' I assured her that I am aware of that, but if my {$2000.00} in payments over a 6 week period was all applied toward daily interest, then something is seriously wrong. She kept saying that she didn't know what to tell me other than "" interest accrues daily. '' I told the rep that I was looking at my account on Navient 's website, and it showed that I was on an extended repayment plan. I asked when I was put on that, and what would my payment be if I were on the standard repayment plan. She placed me on hold, then came back on and told me that I am not currently on ANY payment plan. I asked how I could possibly not be on ANY payment plan, when they require me to pay a minimum of {$590.00} per month. She said that she would have to talk to a manager and placed me on hold again. When she got back on she told me that I WAS on the standard repayment plan. I asked her why then, did my account on their website show that I was on an extended repayment plan. She said that I had apparently requested that payment plan when I had first entered into repayment, and the website never updates that. I told her that doesn't make any sense, and that if I AM on the standard repayment plan, and my standard payment is {$590.00}, then why would that entire amount be going toward interest. The principal balance is not decreasing at all, despite her claim that I am on the standard repayment plan, which is supposed to be the least amount of months to pay the balance. The rep sounded like she had no idea why, but just kept repeating that interest accrues daily. I was getting nowhere, and I didn't have time to keep going round and round with her, so I ended the call. To this day, I still have no answers as to why I have to pay {$590.00} a month, but my balance is not decreasing. I also still have no answers as to what relief options are available for former students of fraudulent schools. 
Because of the numerous claims of fraud and misconduct perpetrated by these for-profit schools, such as XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX , I was able to file a Borrower Defense claim with the Dept. of Education against XXXX, and my federal loans are being reviewed for discharge, as I am a post-class member of the XXXX XXXX XXXX lawsuit settlement. 
I am aware that Navient was sued by 39 state AGs regarding their predatory loans to attend these for-profit schools and that Sallie Mae/Navient were a "" preferred '' lending company in a "" deal '' with these schools during the early XXXX 's. These private loans with a high risk of default were part of a package deal offered to "" for-profit schools ''. I would have qualified to be part of the very limited settlement agreement, but those who were not in default for 7 months or more during a "" specific '' time frame, were excluded. This was like a punch in the gut! There were times over the years that I was 5-6 months past due, but I did absolutely everything I could to prevent them from going into default. The hardships that it caused nearly cost me my marriage and my mental health! And then to find out that if I had just let them go into default, they would've not only been discharged but I could've possibly been paid back some of what I had paid in?! Infuriating! I am sure this was a big win for Navient, but it was a SHAM of a settlement deal for the rest of us borrowers who were scammed into taking loans to at least 150 for profit schools. After the AG settlement, didn't Navient also get out of the Federal student loan business due to scrutiny from lawmakers and borrower advocates? Didn't Navient have to pay restitution to the Federal student loan borrowers for not informing students of IDR/IBR payments students could have enrolled in, but instead steered toward forbearance? Furthermore, hasn't Navient been sued at least a half dozen times for other predatory loan practices and illegal collection practices? 
I am also aware of a "" pilot '' program by which Navient is sending out "" applications '' to select students who may have filed Borrower Defense claims against their schools and were approved.

My Federal loans in the amount of {$70000.00} were discharged and my credit repaired. 

I am aware that Navient was sued by 39 state AGs regarding their predatory loans to attend these online for-profit schools and that Sallie Mae/Navient were a "" preferred '' lending company in a "" deal '' with these schools during the early XXXX 's. 

These private loans with a high risk of default were part of a package deal offered to "" for profit online schools ''. But loans made to students in states outside of the agreement, or those who were not in default for XXXX  months or more during a "" specific '' time frame, were excluded. 

I am sure this was a big win for Navient, but what a sham of a settlement deal for the rest of borrowers scammed into taking loans to at least XXXX for profit online schools. 

After the AG settlement, didn't Navient also get out of the Federal student loan business due to scrutiny from lawmakers and borrower advocates?

Didn't Navient have to pay restitution to the Federal student loan borrowers for not informing students of IDR/IBR payments students could have enrolled in, but instead steered toward forbearance?

Furthermore, hasn't Navient been sued at least a half dozen times for other predatory loan practices and illegal collection practices?

I am also aware of a "" pilot '' program by which Navient is sending out "" applications '' to select students who may have filed Borrower Defense claims against their schools and were approved.

This application is a sham.

Why do we need to prove anything?

Navient knows who we are.

Under the FTC "" Holder Rule '' Navient is liable for giving predatory loans in connection with online for-profit schools.

As a matter of fact, The XXXX XXXX and their Parent company, XXXX were investigated by the attorneys general of several states and have been found to have acted in a fraudulent manner. 
Because of the numerous claims of fraud and misconduct perpetrated by The XXXX XXXX, the Biden administration has just announced a blanket discharge for anyone enrolled at XXXX XXXX XXXX from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. 
My Federal loans in the amount of {$57000.00} were discharged and my credit repaired.

I am aware that Navient was sued by 39 state AGs regarding their predatory loans to attend these online for-profit schools and that Sallie Mae/Navient were a "" preferred '' lending company in a "" deal '' with these schools during the early XXXX 's. 
These private loans with a high risk of default were part of a package deal offered to "" for profit online schools '', but loans made to students in states outside of the agreement, or those who were not in default for 7 months or more during a "" specific '' time frame, were excluded. 
I am sure this was a big win for Navient, but what a sham of a settlement deal for the rest of borrowers scammed into taking loans to at least 150 for profit online schools.

After the AG settlement, didn't Navient also get out of the Federal student loan business due to scrutiny from lawmakers and borrower advocates?

Didn't Navient have to pay restitution to the Federal student loan borrowers for not informing students of IDR/IBR payments students could have enrolled in, but instead steered toward forbearance? 
Furthermore, hasn't Navient been sued at least a half dozen times for other predatory loan practices and illegal collection practices? 
I am also aware of a "" pilot '' program by which Navient is sending out "" applications '' to select students who may have filed Borrower Defense claims against their schools and were approved.

In order to cover the absurd cost of attendance, I was pressured by school counselors to take out private loans, in addition to federal ones. 

The outright fraud and misconduct perpetrated by the XXXX XXXX and its owners, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) and then XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ), are well documented and reported ( see the attachments in this filing ). However, the coordination of Navient Corporation ( previously known as Sallie Mae ) and for-XXXX XXXX XXXX, like the XXXX XXXX , to entrap students in insurmountable private student loan debt has only recently received serious attention. ( The CFPB itself was aware of Navients misconduct at least as far back as XXXXXXXX of XXXX, when it sued Navient for failing borrowers at every stage of repayment ; see attached article. ) In  XXXX of XXXX, Navient settled with XXXX state attorneys general to provide relief totaling {$1.00} XXXX, to resolve allegations of rampant deceptive student loan servicing practices, as well as abuses in originating predatory loans. The summary of the settlement states, Navient also allegedly originated predatory subprime private loans to students attending for-profit schools and colleges with low graduation rates, even though it knew that a very high percentage of such borrowers would be unable to repay the loans. Navient allegedly made these risky subprime loans as an inducement to get schools to use Navient as a preferred lender for highly-profitable federal and prime private loans, without regard for borrowers and their families, many of whom were unknowingly ensnared in debts they could never repay. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, Senator XXXX XXXX, along with XXXX other senators, wrote to Navient, urging it to cancel its fraudulent private student loans, under the FTCs Holder Rule. The letter lists the various abusive and deceptive activities committed by Navient and its partner schools, and it would do the letter injustice to offer a summary -- the letter is included with this filing. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, after the Biden Administration approved {$6.00} XXXX in student debt cancellation for XXXX borrowers who attended the XXXX XXXX, the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX issued a statement, saying, XXXX also partnered with Sallie Mae ( now known as Navient ), to convince XXXX borrowers to take out private student loans to augment their federal student loans. These private loans enabled XXXX to maintain access to federal student aid dollars, and Navient benefited by being a preferred lender of federally-guaranteed student loans for XXXX students. Both XXXX and Navient knew students would not be able to repay these subprime loans and had a side agreement that protected Navient against losses. These private loans are not resolved by todays federal action and will need to be addressed separately with Navient to ensure XXXX  students get full relief. 

XXXX XXXX, the President and Executive Director of XXXX, reiterated, We also urge Navient to recognize that the private student loans it made to XXXX students are also not enforceable and should be cancelled immediately. 

During its XXXX XXXX earnings call, Navient stated that it reserved {$35.00} XXXX due to internal policy changes [ ] made to meet new regulatory expectations related to school misconduct discharges on certain legacy private loans. In addition, Navient plans to transfer these loans to XXXX ( this is also addressed in Senator XXXX  letter ). These are most likely responses not only to the Biden Administrations actions to provide relief to defrauded borrowers, but also to the recent victory of borrowers in the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ( aided by XXXX  ), in which students who attended certain predatory schools ultimately won federal student loan debt relief, including refunds. Navients portfolio contains many private loans taken out by borrowers who attended these schools ; its only reasonable that Navient should anticipate and prepare for adverse action, especially given XXXX involvement and the mounting scrutiny from Senator XXXX and her colleagues, as well as various state attorneys general.",None,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",FL,33625,None,Consent provided,Web,05/08/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,8966612

Their advertising worked, and I decided to attend in XXXX, after graduating XXXX XXXX. 

I then took out over {$35000.00} in student loans with which I was to attend. 

At the end of my XXXX year, I realized it was all wrong. Most of my classmates who graduated could not find work in their major. What work they could find was horribly underpaid. 

Realizing I had been misled, I left. 

Now, 15 years later, the schools are closed and the US Govt. has ruled that the XXXX XXXX need to pay back all their federally backed loans, returning over XXXX XXXX XXXX  to previous borrowers. 

My federal loans were a small part of my overall debt. 

The Private loans are a vastly larger amount, currently the balance sits at over {$14000.00}. 

I have always paid to the best of my ability, and have been in good standing for YEARS.

My loans originated with Sallie Mae and were eventually transferred to Navient. Navient originated predatory subprime private student loans for XXXX XXXX XXXX. The now defunct, XXXX XXXX XXXX had low graduation rates and knew I had low credit scores and lacked sufficient income to repay the loans. Navient made the risky subprime loans anyway. XXXX XXXX XXXX claimed it would be easy to transfer credits to other schools, and I would experience a valuable academic experience. I went into debt to attend XXXX XXXX XXXX, believing that its programs would lead to a promising career with a high salary, but these promises were outright lies. Recruiters preyed on my vulnerable situation, saying whatever was necessary to sell XXXX XXXX XXXX. As a result, I am saddled me with a lifetime of devastating debt. When I could not pay my student loans, Navient steered me into costly long-term forbearances, to bring my account out of default and maxed out my forbearance which forced me into repayment which any chance to take future forbearances or deferments for the remaining life of the loans. Navient did not counseling me about the benefits of more affordable income-driven repayment plans. The interest that accrued because of XXXX forbearance steering practices added to my loan balances, pushing me further in debt. 

The Original Private Loan Principal amount was {$6000.00}. Over the life of this loan, I have paid over {$28000.00}. As of XX/XX/XXXX, the Current Principal {$7500.00} with a current Variable Interest Rate of 18.50 %. In XXXX, I was granted federal loan cancellation of XXXX federal student loans by the Department of Education loans by filing Borrower Defense to Loan Repayment Applications alleging school misconduct. The Department of Education discharged my federal loans because of the pervasive and widespread nature of ITTs school conduct. 

There was private loan debt relief for private subprime student loans ( made to borrowers with low credit scores ) through Navients predecessor, Sallie Mae, between XXXX and XXXX, for borrowers that attended for-profit school XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX as it had been subject to state or federal law enforcement actions but I was not included in that relief. There was also private loan debt relief for private subprime student loans relief for Navient borrowers that filed bankruptcy and did not recertify their debt. I filed Navient private loan debt in a Tennessee XXXX XXXX bankruptcy court and did not recertify this debt. However, I was not included in that relief. I filed a couple of school closure discharge forms with Navient but they were denied with a reason given. 

I contacted Navient requesting an application for school misconduct discharge but was told if I qualify, they will mail out a form in the future.

When I signed for these private student loans I had no idea what anything meant and did not know the interest rate I was agreeing to or even that it was variable. All I was told by the financial advisor at XXXX was that I needed to take out the loan to continue my education. XXXX also completely lied about their job placement rates saying 90 % of their graduates were hired in their field within six months of graduation, which never happened for me. They also had a flyer they showed me that said how much a graduate is expected to make with their degree which was also a lie. 

Navient has been incredibly unhelpful in providing me any assistance with these private student loans, as they basically always say there are no options for me.

I have, to date, paid back over {$86000.00} - paying more than the original principle. 

I am currently dealing with an identity theft case where someone took out {$48000.00} in student loans in my name in California ( I live and have been living in Tennessee during this time period ). These were XXXX Federal Loans and I am working with police and the government to prove this fraud. It has nothing to do with Navient or private loans. 

But Navient, without my permission, capitalized interest on my loans. 
They now show that I owe them ( the principle amount ) {>= $1,000,000} This has created an undue burden on my ability to pay my bills. And they are now wanting to place me into default. 

Yet they claim that if I wanted to pay these loans off today, my principle is {$140000.00}. 
This is clearly abusive and has created undue financial strain as they have increased interest payments to 17 %, and now require a monthly payment on par with a home mortgage. 

How can I, after having paid them for 14 years, having paid over {$86000.00} to them, owe them TWICE as much as when I began? 

Add that the school was closed and they were sued for misleading students. 
I was told they were accredited and they WERE NOT. I have a degree that has been USELESS in assisting me in finding meaningful, steady employment. That I can not use to continue my education should I seek. And I have ALREADY paid back and then some. 

And Navient is harassing me. I get 6-8 phone calls a day. My co-signer gets 6-8 phone calls a day. And the come from in-state numbers with no identification. 

I want the harassment to stop! I want them to dismiss my loans as I have ALREADY paid them {$7100.00} more than original principle. I want them to remove the negative credit reporting from my credit bureau and my co-signer 's credit bureau. 

I have all of the documentation ( statements, tax documents, etc... ) and am more than happy to share them with any agent ( s ) you assign to investigate my case. I believe this to be a clear case of predatory lending, harassment, and clear misuse of their authority to manage my loans.

I have had my federal student loans discharged through the Borrower Defense program, as a full class member of the XXXX XXXX XXXX class action lawsuit. I am now seeking discharge of my private loans.

I have two Signature Student Loans through Navient, with a current balance totaling {$25000.00}. At the time I took the loans out, it was through XXXX XXXX, but they were converted to Navient without me doing any sort of refinancing. 

It has been well documented by a series of investigations ( US Senate ), lawsuits, and settlements that the school and other for-profit colleges were engaged in a number of predatory practices. In addition to the false advertising, high pressure sales tactics, and lies about school accreditation, XXXX was also involved with selling private loans to me in a way that seems predatory. I was told I could not enroll in the program without taking on private student loans. I was only given one company to choose from, when in reality there were many options available. I was told that I had to have a cosigner and my dad completed the application in a hasty manner so I could get enrolled. The original documentation was lost by XXXX XXXX, and we had to do it again. 

In retrospect, I see that the tuition amounts for the school was set to the exact dollar amount that federal loans would cover for junior and senior level students. Freshman and sophomore students had lower federal student loan limits, so we were basically forced to take on private student loans if we wanted to complete this program and did not have the cash up front. The school was eeking out every XXXX they could get away with, while providing us with an "" educaton '' that has proven to not be transferrable to other schools. I have been denied entry to state schools for masters programs because XXXX doesn't have the right accreditation. 

At the time I just thought this was how it worked. But after talking to other students and seeing multiple lawsuits come to light, it is clear to me this was a scam. 

I did not qualify for discharge under the Navient settlement with XXXX attorneys general because my payments were never more than 7 months behind, despite my school being on their list of schools. Had I ever defaulted, my private loans would have been discharged. 

Furthermore, Navient has also been unreliable and predatory in its collection efforts. 

When I was having financial difficulties during the 2008 recession and again after a divorce in the XXXX time period, I would call to request forbearance or any help. They often did not tell me about programs that would have helped me, only giving me the options to continue a high minimum payment. Sometimes this was with my federal loans, when an income driven repayment would have been available to me with XXXX XXXX  monthly payments ; other times it was with private loans. Often both types of loans were discussed on the same call. I kept minimal records because I was trusting the process at the time. 

On the strictly private loan side, I did a few interest rate reduction programs where I was only paying interest. I would have to sign up for an automatic payment withdrawal and continue for XXXX  months with no missed payments, and that would make me eligible for a cosigner release. Or at least that's what they told me. A payment or two would be withdrawn, and then no more withdrawals would happen despite money being in my account. This would put my loan account in delinquency and I would receive a ton of harassment ( so would my dad, the cosigner ) and when I would call to make a payment, Navient would somehow claim to have no record of the payment plan. 

I have never been able to make changes to my account online, I always have to call. The call reps rush and then I have to listen to and approve verbal terms of agreement, which does not feel like a scenario where I can do my due diligence on what the actual terms are. Phone calls are not a paper record, and it was all too convenient for them to not have record of arranged payment plans. 

I have spoken to a few friends with similar loans, and they have identical stories. It feels like a systematic failure and generally predatory practice on multiple fronts.

The problem is that when I was offered the Structured rate reduction program in XXXX, the program was set to expire in XXXX, as documents showed to prove it. I recieved notices about updating my financial information ETC. In XXXX XXXX, as per the letter that was uploaded by Navient, the notice said about the program expiring. If your calls are recorded ( thankfully I record every call I have with Navient ) you can see that I called in a nervous wreck and spoke to a representative to obtain clarity. I am always on top of my Navient account especially because I fought to have the repayment option in the first place after being in default! The representative assured me that the notice was to give me an update that they need my financial information in order for the plan to NOT EXPIRE. And I said ok that makes sense because my documents show that the program will end in XXXX. 
During the last call I was NOT given any options although my salary is the same and my family size increase by XXXX. I had no choice to do the in school deferment but that is not what I wanted.

Upon entering into an agreement with XXXX  and the Department of Education for a school loan, I was led to believe that the terms provided were fair and transparent. However, it has become evident that critical information regarding the loan, including its profitability and associated risks, were not fully disclosed. 

Furthermore, despite encountering significant difficulties due to language barriers, the information provided was insufficient and failed to adequately convey the true nature of the loan. This lack of clarity and understanding has left me facing financial difficulties and uncertainty.

I demand immediate action to rectify this situation, including a thorough investigation into the misrepresentation of the loan terms and appropriate compensation for the damages incurred.

I now have children who are getting ready to attend College and it is hard for me to provide a future for my children while I am still tied down by this loan which was originally created because of promises that XXXX XXXX guaranteed which as the lawsuit mentions was never the case. Thank you for your time. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX I have attached an article from Attorney General XXXX XXXX XXXX 

____________________________________________ Thursday, XX/XX/XXXX XXXX -- Attorney General XXXX XXXX announced today that the Arizona Attorney General 's Office, along with 47 other states and the District of Columbia, reached a multimillion-dollar settlement with XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX and its related entities ( collectively, XXXX  ) following a five-year investigation by the attorneys general. As part of the settlement, XXXX is agreeing to forgo any and all efforts to collect amounts owed to XXXX by former students residing in the participating states, including more than {$22.00} XXXX for over XXXX eligible Arizonans who attended specific schools ( including online courses ). 

XXXX has agreed to reform its recruiting and enrollment practices and forgo collecting about {$490.00} XXXX in debts owed by XXXX students nationally. 

XXXX is a for-profit education company that operated schools across the country, including multiple campuses in Arizona that are no longer in business. The state attorneys general allege XXXX engaged in a number of unfair and deceptive practices for years, including misleading prospective students about actual costs, the transferability of credits, accreditation, program offerings, and accurate job placement rates. 

The investigation by the attorneys general revealed evidence demonstrating that XXXX : Deceived students about the total costs of enrollment by instructing its admissions representatives to inform prospective students only about the cost per credit hour without disclosing the total number of required credit hours; Misled students about the transferability of credits into XXXX from other institutions and out of XXXX to other institutions by promising on some occasions that credits would transfer ; Misrepresented the potential for students to obtain employment in their field by failing to adequately disclose the fact that certain programs lacked the necessary programmatic accreditation ; and, Deceived prospective students about the rate that graduates of XXXX programs got a job in their field of study, thereby giving prospective students a distorted and inaccurate impression of XXXX graduates employment outcomes. For instance, XXXX inaccurately claimed that its graduates were placed who actually worked only temporarily or who were working in unrelated jobs. 
The debt relief from the settlement will completely eliminate the existing balances held by XXXX for those consumers in either XXXX of the following categories : Students who attended XXXX XXXX UXXXX  or XXXX XXXX XXXX  AND completed their classes before XX/XX/XXXX, OR Students who attended any XXXX school that was closed prior to XX/XX/XXXX, including XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX - XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX  XXXX, and XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX

05/25/24,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"Thousands of students were scammed by Navient ( formerly XXXX XXXX ) into taking out predatory private loans to attend for profit schools such as the one I attended, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  - XXXX XXXX. As a matter of fact, XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  - XXXX XXXX was investigated by the California Attorney General XXXX XXXX. 
Because of the numerous claims of fraud and misconduct perpetrated by these for profit schools, such as XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  - XXXX XXXX, I was able to file a Borrower Defense claim with the Dept. of Education against XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and my Federal student loans of over {$100000.00} are going to be discharged and my credit repaired. When I was enrolled into the program, they told us that our tuition rates would be "" locked in '' for the duration of the program, yet I remember at least once, they did implement rate hikes in the middle of my program. After my first year, the school convinced me to ask my XXXX to co-sign for the private loans because my federal loans ran out, and my mother had just passed away so I had no immediate family to turn to. My uncle seemed to feel obligated, I believe, in some way to help me. Not being able to pay these sub-prime loans has put a strain on our relationship due to the credit hit the co-signing has caused. I called and asked to get my uncle released as my cosigner after over 10 years, but Navient said I would have to pay the full amount of the monthly payments, which I could not afford. If the school had not convinced me that my education would come to an end if I did not get these private loans ( which have ballooned to nearly {$80000.00} so far ), my life would be in a much better place. The school also knew that their education would not be sufficient to fetch the salary required to repay the loans, nor job prospects they promised, and I believe Navient also knew this as well. When I was unemployed they refused to work with me to pause my payments or offer any kind of recourse, and while I was barely scraping by with my family they wouldn't even refer me to any type of program to assist me, instead they insisted I nearly make my family homeless paying these impossible amounts, stay indebted forever, and cause unspeakable stress and anguish for years. 
My Borrower Defense Claim was also part of the XXXX XXXX XXXX settlement for which I was a Post-class member. 
I am aware that Navient was sued by XXXX state AGs regarding their predatory loans to attend these for-profit schools and that Sallie Mae/Navient were a "" preferred '' lending company in a "" deal '' with these schools during the early 2000 's. These private loans with a high risk of default were part of a package deal offered to "" for profit online schools ''. But loans made to students in states outside of the agreement, or those who were not in default for 7 months or more during a "" specific '' time frame, were excluded. I am sure this was a big win for Navient, but what a sham of a settlement deal for the rest of borrowers scammed into taking loans to at least XXXX for profit schools. After the AG settlement, didn't Navient also get out of the Federal student loan business due to scrutiny from lawmakers and borrower advocates? Didn't Navient have to pay restitution to the Federal student loan borrowers for not informing students of IDR/IBR payments students could have enrolled in, but instead steered toward forbearance? Furthermore, hasn't Navient been sued at least a half dozen times for other predatory loan practices and illegal collection practices? 
I am also aware of a "" pilot '' program by which Navient is sending out "" applications '' to select students who may have filed Borrower Defense claims against their schools and were approved. This application is a sham. Why do we need to prove anything? Navient knows who we are. Under the FTC "" Holder Rule '' Navient is liable for giving predatory loans in connection with online for-profit schools.

As a matter of fact, The XXXX Institutes were investigated by the Dept. of Education.

My Borrower Defense Claim was also part of the Sweet Vs. Cardona settlement for which I was a full class member.

I am sure this was a big win for Navient, but what a sham of a settlement deal for the rest of borrowers scammed into taking loans to at least 150 for profit online schools. After the AG settlement, Navient als

04/12/24,Student loan,Private student loan,Getting a loan,High pressure sales tactics or recruiting,"I am writing to express my concerns regarding the student loan [ predatory ] practices at the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ), a branch of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, which have led to significant financial difficulties for my family and I. The servicer they used for Private Student Loans was Sallie Mae. 

Important details : Attendance Dates : XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX Initial Loan Disbursement Amount : {$59000.00} Total repaid : {$40000.00} Balance as of XX/XX/XXXX : {$110000.00} Since my initial enrollment in XX/XX/XXXX, I was consistently compelled rather than encouraged to pursue private student loans to finance my education at XXXX. This sense of coercion has led to profound financial ramifications, significantly impacting my financial stability and future prospects. These private loans have been the source of considerable financial strain and has had an exceedingly negative impact on my financial well-being. 

Throughout my tenure at the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX interactions with counselors were infrequent, and when they occurred, it was near the conclusion of each academic term. During which the focus was predominantly on securing additional student loans, including private student loans, specifically from Sallie Mae ( now with Navient ). In retrospect, the emphasis of the XXXX counselors seemed to be on facilitating the acquisition of funds rather than providing comprehensive guidance on the implications and long-term consequences of such financial commitments. 
The student loans I took out were intended to cover both my tuition and what was purported to be "" housing '' expenses at XXXX. However, despite this, I was never provided with a lease agreement, a breakdown of utility costs, or an itemized invoice for any housing-related expenses. This lack of transparency left me completely unaware of the true extent of these expenses. Whenever I inquired about these details, I was simply assured that the student loans would cover everything. 
Furthermore, the school operated under an egregious and high-pressure cycle, particularly before the beginning of each quarter. I felt constant pressure to sign student loan documents before classes commenced, and I was consistently urged to take the maximum credit course load and to utilize my private student loan credit and complete my degree "" on time. '' Failure to comply with these demands was met with the threat from XXXX counselors of being unable to continue attending school during the following quarter unless I could provide proof of funding at registration or before classes began and maintain full-time student status. 
As a first-generation college student, I was unaware of the unethical and predatory nature of these practices at the time. It wasn't until I was nearing the end of my tenure at XXXX, particularly during the culmination of my studies when I prepared my portfolio for review, that I began to recognize these issues. In the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX students were required to compile and present their XXXX at the XXXX XXXX XXXX during their last quarter, marking the final step toward graduation. During these XXXX XXXX, students presented their work to department chairs and faculty members, who would then review and evaluate our XXXX. Ultimately, deciding whether we would be able to graduate. 
The challenge arose when students received critiques deemed unsatisfactory. While recommendations for improvement were provided by the chair and faculty, no specific rubric was given to clarify what constituted an unsatisfactory XXXX. Instead, it was left to the subjective discretion of the faculty members to determine satisfactory quality. If a XXXX received an unsatisfactory rating, the student would need to update it based on the critique before the following quarter 's XXXX XXXX. 
Herein lies a significant issue : the faculty members responsible for reviewing XXXX changed each quarter. Additionally, due to the lack of clear guidelines and the subjective nature of XXXX XXXX, the updated work was often evaluated by new members with differing opinions from those who originally reviewed it. This inconsistency created a situation where students ' efforts to improve their XXXX were hindered by shifting standards and subjective judgments. 
It's crucial to highlight that the XXXX XXXX occurred during the last quarter before graduation. However, students who did not pass were still strongly encouraged to maintain a full course load to remain in the program and participate in the next quarter 's XXXX XXXX. Failure to do so risked being dropped from the program, preventing attendance at the subsequent XXXX XXXX and graduation. 
In late XXXX, during my last quarter at XXXX, I attempted a second XXXX XXXX  and received an unsatisfactory critique. Realizing that attempting a third review and taking more courses was financially unfeasible for me, I made the difficult decision to withdraw from XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. Little did I know that my struggles with the loans I was persuaded to take out had only just begun. I chose to work full-time instead of returning to pursue a degree in fear of taking out more student loans. I elected to forego necessities like XXXX XXXX during this time in order to receive more in net pay, and did not make enough to make ends meet. 
After the expiration of my six-month grace period, I began receiving the first of many statements to repay my student loans. The balance for my private loans at the time was over {$60000.00}. With my federal loans adding about another {$30000.00} or so. 
Upon facing this new financial predicament, I sought information about different repayment options from other former students of XXXX. However, when I inquired with Sallie Mae/NAVIENT about options such as income-based repayment, lower interest rates, or adjusting repayment terms, I received conflicting information on different calls. While my federal loans offered the possibility of income-based repayment, my private loans did not provide that option. 
For several years, I found myself unable to make the minimum payment for my private loans despite my efforts. Sallie Mae/NAVIENT offered me no resolution and even threatened default. Eventually, in about XXXX or so, I was informed that I could make interest-only payments, but was warned that the interest rates would rise as they were variable, which indeed happened, reaching double digits. Despite my efforts to make payments and sacrificing basic necessities, I saw my balance continue to grow. 
The financial strain I experienced caused me distress in the years after leaving XXXX. It wasn't until XXXX, on the brink of financial ruin, that I made any progress. It was at this time, I made the decision to enlist in the XXXX XXXX. While I wish I could say it was driven by a personal calling or a desire to make my family proud, my primary motivation was to cap my interest rates through the Service Members Civil Relief Act. 
However, my efforts to enlist were immediately impeded. Before finalizing my enlistment, I needed to obtain official copies of my college transcripts. XXXX students were unable to begin their classes until payment for the classes was secured, however, when I went to obtain my transcripts in XX/XX/XXXX, I was told I needed to pay a final balance before they could provide me with transcripts. When asked for an itemized bill, while they were able to provide one, they were unable to answer my questions regarding why I had the balance, considering I withdrew XX/XX/XXXX, and charges on the bill included charges from XXXX and XXXX and XXXX. Again, when I left XXXX, I had a significant student loan balance, however, my balance at XXXX was {$0.00}. I pressed for reasons why, but was told that there was nothing that could be done, and that fortunately I wasn't sent to collections so XXXX could receive payment directly. As mentioned, I was on the brink of financial ruin and needed desperately to obtain my transcript to enlist in the XXXX. The XXXX employee even had the audacity to suggest to me to take out a personal loan to cover the cost of the bill. Fortunately, I was able to borrow the money from my relatives, and joined the XXXX. 
In XXXX, I officially enlisted in the XXXX. This allowed me to postpone payments on my student loans, without going into default, until I figured out my financial situation. Around this time frame Navient became the new lender for my student loans. It seemed as though after I joined the XXXX the calls from /NAVIENT became less and less. However, I did not want to postpone my student loans too long, as my goal was to pay off my student loans as quickly as possible. But by XXXX I had been making payments for a few years at that point with the balance only getting bigger. Fortunately, my interest rate went from the double digits down to 6 %. Despite joining the XXXX, $ XXXX {$1200.00} minimum monthly payments were not feasible, and I continued to find ways to lower the rate, adjust payment terms, or find some income-based repayment for my private student loans. However, over the next couple years, it seemed as though depending on the representative I would receive different answers for those questions. From one person to the next as far as if a loan could be included in various states of repayment or programs. As far as I was concerned it was obscured on purpose, and the reality was that the Navient representative could not, or would not help. As the years passed after withdrawing from XXXX, I found out that private student loans have minimal repayment options other than standard. I also learned that regardless of the repayment option, balances will continue to grow. Which is what has happened with my account. Over the last 10 years or so I have applied payments towards my private students. And the increase has been significant, with the aggregate balance, as of XX/XX/XXXX, having increased over 90 % no matter how much money I have applied to my loans. I have tried addressing principal, interest, and asked for explanations of how much and how long it would take to pay off my loans in their entirety, I pay more than the minimum payment, and yet my balances continue to increase dramatically. 
In XXXX I found out that the borrower defense to repayment had expanded to include schools that misled students, even those that did not close within 6 months of withdrawal. Unfortunately, I applied and was denied in XXXX, and, until recently, I had over {$160000.00} in student loans from XXXX ( this included my federal loans ). I reapplied in XXXX. And later saw there are several people like me who suffered because of XXXX and other for-profit colleges greed, and the XXXX XXXX XXXX case allowed my federal XXXX loans to be discharged. Specifically, XXXX was one of the schools listed in the XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX settlement that would receive automatic discharge. XXXX was guilty for using fraudulent practices, illegal recruitment and enrollment tactics, etc. and preyed upon students for their own financial benefit. Then after withdrawal Sallie Mae and Navient were insensitive, uninformed, and are just as guilty as XXXX in unifying with them to offer private predatory student loans. 

For years after my experience with the XXXX XXXX and my attempted repayment to NAVIENT I have struggled with the burden of deciding, not what was in my best interest or my spouse, but putting every aspect of my future on hold, in order to pay my student loans. 

While I am thankful to be serving in the XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, this decision ultimately came after facing the ultimatum of enlisting to take advantage of military deferments and Service Members Civil Relief Act or defaulting on my student loans. 

I do not dwell on what the {$40000.00} in payments could have bought, but how many times I delayed starting a family, or investing towards retirement. Although it is difficult not to, considering I never finished my degree with XXXX nor did I ever work in the field I went to school there for. However, wIthout a doubt, every aspect of my financial position has been adversely affected by the weight of my student loans from my credit score, job opportunities, the APR for any credit ( auto, cards, etc. ).",None,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",WA,98373,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,04/12/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,8759526

06/15/24,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"This is in regards to a private student loan ( {$20000.00} ) from Navient. I applied for this loan in XX/XX/XXXX when I was in graduate school for which I had a co-signer. In XX/XX/XXXX, my co-signer filed for bankruptcy and, through the procedures, half of the balance at the time ( appx. {$14000.00} ) was automatically paid off. Since, Navient sent me emails with {$0.00} due and explained that a large payment constituted a payment ahead of the schedule and it was no longer due for a while. I had never ( and have still never ) experienced such a large payment situation and I did not understand what that meant. I figured when payments resume I can just make normal payments ( principal + interest as before ). Because this occurred shortly before the COVID pandemic, I tried to balance out the challenges that came with that and believed their recurrent emails that constantly showed {$0.00} due ( no interest payments required or suggested were every mentioned ). In XX/XX/XXXX, payments restarted and I called to inquire about paying additional every month towards my principal so I can expedite the loan payment. At this time, Navient refused to allow me to make any payments towards the principal until I first paid the interest accrued since XXXX ( appx. {$5000.00} which I am not in a position to pay off ). They provided the original loan documents which state that payments go first towards the interest and then principal. I understand that I signed those documents but I had no power over the payment ahead being made in XXXX and not XXXX time since XXXX did Navient attempt to contact me and explain how this was going to work beyond emailing me that I HAVE NOTHING DUE. I find this to be a very predatory practice as is their refusal to allow me to make partial payments towards my loan principal at this time IN ADDITION to the interest payments they are requiring. My account is current and I reached out to their XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX which only invoked the same documentation and closed the file. Because the interest will continue to grow, I have no way of catching up any time soon in this manner because the balance will continue to grow as the interest keeps adding to the constantly growing amount without being able to pay anything towards the principal. I have also requested them to cancel out my interest since XXXX due to their failure to communicate with me and explain about the implications but they refused that.

06/05/24,Student loan,Private student loan,Getting a loan,High pressure sales tactics or recruiting,"In XXXX when I enrolled in XXXX XXXX XXXX  at XXXX, the school encouraged me to reach out to Navient ( formerly Sallie Mae ) for student loans when I did not have the financial ability to cover the tuition. The determination to continue enrollment was based solely on the ability to obtain the student loans from Navient. Without the loans, I did not have the financial capacity to pay the full tuition. Navient encouraged me to apply for a private student loan called a XXXX XXXX. These were predatory loans that Navient and XXXX XXXX XXXX  worked together to encourage me to take. XXXX XXXX XXXX never mentioned there were other options for loans, they directly encouraged me to contact Navient. They also told me they were the easiest to get approved at. The school told me that I would graduate with a degree that would provide me the opportunity to make good money and pay the loans back. They promised that I would graduate, be able to get a higher paying job. This is not the case. I had to leave Hawaii to find a position that paid a low salary but enough to cover living expenses. I was barely able to make any payments to my student loans. Navient never encouraged me to continue to take federal loans with lower rates, they just encouraged me to borrow more and more private loans. 
Once I had secured the loans, the school began requiring me to take additional courses, repeat courses they had originally accepted, claiming they didnt meet their standards, repeat courses that were identical to classes I had already taken, yet they deemed not equivalent. The classes were identical. This delayed my graduation and ensured that I would pay more to the school for classes I had already completed at the school I transferred from.

Sallie Mae knew I was not credit worthy. I did not have a co-signer or a job that paid more than {$20000.00} a year and they still lent me {$36000.00} dollars worth of loans that would compound annually at a rate that was unachievable for a low income person. Navient approved me without much effort. At that time XXXX XXXX XXXX, working at a job that paid minimum wage, I had no credit. Navient quickly approved me for an 11.5 % student loan, sent me a check for {$7500.00} to start the other {$7500.00} would come at another time. Navient never explained that I would be limited to this interest rate even if I was to graduate, obtain a good paying job, and increase my credit score. This was misleading to me. I thought as I was able to obtain higher credit score, my rate could be reduced. This was not the case, nor was this disclosed to me. Navient continued to issue more credit to me despite my inability to make payments, or any foreseeable future employment that would allow me to cover these loans. In XXXX they distributed {$15000.00}, in XXXX they distributed {$8400.00}, in XXXX they distributed {$12000.00} for a total of {$36000.00}. 
They also charged me capitalized interest in XXXX of {$7000.00}, in XXXX capitalized interest of {$2500.00}, in XXXX capitalized interest of {$140.00}, in XXXX Capitalized interest of {$4500.00}, in XXXX capitalized interest of {$480.00}, in XXXX capitalized interst of {$1300.00} for a total of {$16000.00}. 
Upon graduation, when I was able to start repaying the loans, Navient would not reduce the payment amount to something affordable. I struggled for years to pay this. The only option that Navient would offer me was to defer/forebearance with a fee, while the interst still compounded. Navient never introduced me to any payment plans, anything income related, they just encouraged me to file for forebearance. The entire time in repayment, I wasnt really aware of the overall affects of all of these decisions until I needed a security clearance and the security officer encouraged me to consolidate with another company. It was then that Navient offered to transfer me to NaviRefi, their internal refinance company. Navient was then having me pay interest only payments, which ballooned my balance. This was years after struggling to make payment. In XXXX Navient transferred my loan balance of {$42000.00} to XXXX XXXX. This meant that even after years of making payments, I still owed more than I initially took. Navient also made me agree to pay additional time on my student loans, which increased the maximum amount I would have to pay. This was my only option to reduce the interst rate despite having an XXXX credit score for years. Navient also continued to process all payments to my lower interest lower balance loans and left my XXXX Signature Student with a high balance high interest rate. This ensured they would secure the highest interest rate compounded. I have paid over $ XXXX in payments and I still owe $ XXXX. Navient never applied the payments I made to the loans with highest interest rates. This kept my loan balances high on those which had the highest interest rates. 
Navient forced me into the refinance of my private loans after YEARS of charging high interest rates and multiple requests for a lower rate based on current credit score. Navient reused. When I went to find another servicer, Navient conveniently pushed me towards their refinance program. When I asked for the application for forgiveness, Navient then tells me that those loans are not eligible. This is a blatant attempt to keep me from holding them accuntable for their deceptive loan servicing, and their continued mistreatment of borrowers. 
In XXXX this year, NaviRefi transferred my loan without telling me to XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
Navient has, for decades, aggressively collected payments on loans that it knows are eligible for cancellationXXXX40 These predatory loans were given to students at subprime rates, while Navient XXXX with colleges that lied to borrowers about course credits, career prospects, and programs. Under the XXXX XXXX and due to Navient and Sallie Maes misconduct, Navient is liable for these predatory loans and should discharge them immediately. 
Due to all of Navients predatory deceptive measures, I put off major life things such as having children, buying at house, etc. Im now XXXX and in a position to have a child, and being forced to undergo XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Its going to cost me {$40000.00} which It wouldnt have if I had been financially able to when I was younger.

05/23/24,Student loan,Private student loan,Getting a loan,Confusing or misleading advertising,"NaviRefi employs a bait and switch tactic that puts a hard inquiry on students looking for loan refinancing.

Then, when you click on the button, you get to this page : XXXX XXXX XXXXnavirefiXXXX XXXX  At the bottom of the page, you STILL see a notice that says "" Continuing this step won't affect your credit.

The SWITCH happens by the time you get to a third screen and they allege that the message changes suddenly to, "" ah, but this will affect your credit, after all. '' They hide or delay a completely polar opposite message -- after LURING you into the screen for several steps, rather than clearly labeling that completion of the process is, in fact, a hard inquiry.

08/22/24,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"SUMMARY : Navient has failed to produce my original loan agreement/promissory note with my signature and consent, because it is likely that they do not have it. I have found an agreement noting several issues and contradictions, and I am trying to compare my findings with the agreement that Navient has on file for me. However, I now believe that Navient does not actually have this agreement on file. They have sent everything BUT the promissory note. They do not have the original loan agreement, or they do, but are hiding their copy because they may have noticed something on it that I myself, given my legal training, have noticed. 

A second issue is that I am filing this complaint to report discriminatory treatment by a Navient customer service representative during a call asking for the promissory note/loan agreement. 

On XX/XX/scrub>XXXX XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX, I contacted Navient to inquire about the status of my promissory note, a critical document necessary for reviewing the terms of my student loan. During the call, the representative rudely and unprofessionally sighed upon hearing my last name, and failed to say it or provide a reason for why she was not able not say it, which I perceived as discriminatory. When I addressed this behavior, the representative dismissed my concerns, stating, "" You can take it how you want to take it, '' before abruptly hanging up on me. This interaction was both unprofessional and discriminatory. 

I immediately called back and spoke with a supervisor, XXXX XXXX, at approximately XXXXXXXX XXXX. Despite my request for legal department contact information, I was only provided with a general mailing address. 

Additionally, despite multiple requests, Navient has failed to provide me with a copy of my promissory note. This document is essential for verifying the terms of my loan and protecting my legal and financial rights. 

Basis for Complaint : XXXX ) Discriminatory Treatment : The representative 's behavior during our conversation suggests a potential bias or discrimination based on my identity. This is unacceptable and violates the principles of fair and respectful customer service. 

XXXX ) Failure to Provide Promissory Note : I have requested a copy of my promissory note on multiple occasions, yet Navient has failed to provide it -- because they likely do not have it. This document is crucial for verifying the terms of my loan and protecting my legal and financial rights. Navient needs to produce their copy, with my signature, NOW. They either do not have a copy, or they do but do not want to release it, because they have noticed something on it, like I have, that could land them in hot water. They failed to write the agreement properly when it came from XXXX XXXX to them and now that they are in the middle of transferring to XXXX, they will not be able to get away with it. They need to IMMEDIATELY send this note. I have requested it TWICE and each time they have lied and said they sent it. The documents they sent were not a copy of the promissory note. I will take instant legal action if they continue to fail to comply. 


I will be seeking further legal action on this matter, if not resolved satisfactorily. Although I will mail their legal contact, please note that a judge has ruled that Navient can not compel the borrower to arbitration. Although Navient argued that one of their borrowers was bound by an arbitration clause from the original loan agreement, the judge found that only certain entities explicitly listed in the agreement, such as the original lender ( XXXX ) and its successors, had the authority to compel arbitration. Navient, as a loan servicer, was not included in that list and, therefore, could not enforce the arbitration clause. The judge concluded that without clear evidence that Navient was a successor or had the right to invoke arbitration under the agreement, the borrower was not required to resolve the dispute through arbitration. Furthermore, given the date/time and language of my original loan agreement, I am not compelled to follow arbitration procedures. 



Request for CFPB Action : I request that the CFPB investigate this matter and ensure that Navient addresses these issues promptly. I also ask that the CFPB monitor Navient to prevent future instances of discriminatory treatment and failure to provide essential loan documentation.

03/20/24,Student loan,Private student loan,Struggling to repay your loan,Problem lowering your monthly payments,"In the year XXXX, I enrolled into XXXX  XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  in XXXX, Virginia. To pursue my education, I was encouraged by the recruiter, with assistance from the financial aid office staff, to take out federal and private student loans. In XXXX, I graduated from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX with a XXXX XXXX XXXX in the course of XXXX XXXX  without employment opportunities from the schools strong relationships with big corporations. 

Post-graduation, I was able to recognize how predatory the student loans actually were and how misleading the overall cost of the program would be. The school failed to make me aware of the actual amount that I would actually have to pay by the time the loan is fully payed off. The total tuition cost was approximately {$110000.00}. I have been paying these loans consistently and on time for about 12 years and I still owe around {$100000.00}. Over the past 12 years I have paid between $ XXXX {$16000.00} per year on these loans collectively. Clearly these loans werent meant to help fund education but meant make graduation students passive income for predatory lenders. I was put under the impression that as long as I pay the requested amount I should be able to pay off loan amount in initial expected loan terms. I feel like I was encouraged to participate in unfair and unmanageable loan terms. At the moment, even if I continue to pay the requested monthly amount, which is upwards of {$1100.00} per month, I will not be able to pay the loans off before I die as the interest will never allow me to. I feel like the plan was to make ambitious scholars like myself lifetime passive income for the lenders that are in association with the XXXX XXXX. During the pandemic, the lenders of those loans Navient Solutions , LLC and XXXX XXXX, XXXX decided to double their interest rates and ultimately boost my monthly payments to almost double of what they were pre-pandemic. Also, Ive been paying these loans by myself and they refuse to grant my request for a Cosigner Release as I have been denied multiple times. They know what my income is and have boosted my monthly payment every time I submitted a request for cosigner release so that they can say that I dont make enough money to qualify for cosigner release. 

The school exaggerated likely after-graduation earnings and during the recruiting process, I was told and lead to believe that, in my field, I should expect to make upwards of {$70000.00} per year upon graduation. The school also promoted direct access to XXXX 's relationships with big corporations '' that would offer expected salary. Unfortunately, neither claim by the school was legitimate. The school misrepresented it's partnerships with employers. I was told that for my graduation class ' XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, there would be job recruiters specific to my field in attendance. I was under the impression that recruiters would be present and that I would have an opportunity to present my skills and resume to increase hiring opportunities. there were no recruiters specific to my major/career field in attendance. I was presented the idea that the career services department at each school has built strong relationships with big corporations and small businesses but none were present and no direct referral of my skills and services to these companies was made. 
As a result of the misleading a predatory behavior from XXXX  XXXX XXXX, I was left with the decision to submit and file a U.S. Department of Education Borrower Defense to Repayment Application to studentaid.gov in XXXX of XXXX. The decision on the BDR application is still pending as of XX/XX/XXXX.

The U.S. Department of Education has recently granted loan forgiveness to students who attended the XXXX XXXX due to widespread and pervasive substantial misrepresentations that deceived students about the value they would be receiving from their education. 

Despite the recognition of these fraudulent practices and the subsequent loan forgiveness for federal loans, my private student loans remain outstanding, and Navient is threatening legal action against me. I currently owe {$18000.00}. 

I have consistently tried to make my payments, but with the rising cost of living, my payments have become unaffordable for me and my family. I have paid them what I could afford and I reached out to Navient to request an affordable payment plan. However, their only option was to lower the monthly payment slightly, which still left the payment above the threshold I could afford each month. When I asked them to work with my term limits, they declined and insisted that I either take their only payment option or face litigation. 

During my last conversation with XXXX, a representative from Navient, I explained that I couldn't afford their proposed payment option and that I couldn't sacrifice my family 's necessities to make the payments. XXXX rudely cut me off, stated she wasn't going to argue with me, and said she would forward my case to their lawyers to take me to court before abruptly hanging up on me. 

This treatment is not only unfair but also disrespectful. I believe that Navient should take into consideration the fraudulent practices of the XXXX XXXX and work with me to find a reasonable and affordable repayment solution.

As a matter of fact, XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXXXXXX XXXX  was investigated by the Department of Education. I had to consolidate my private loans which I had no idea that they were not a federal loan program. Because I was young, My dad had to co-sign and he is being drug into this and it's ruining his credit along with mine. Because of the numerous claims of fraud and misconduct perpetrated by these online for-profit schools, such as XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXXXXXX XXXX , I was able to file a Borrower Defense claim with the Dept. of Education against XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXXXXXX XXXX, and my Fed. loans of XXXX were discharged and my credit repaired.

But loans made to students in states outside of the agreement, or those who were not in default for 7 months or more during a "" specific '' time frame, were excluded. I am sure this was a big win for Navient, but what a sham of a settlement deal for the rest of borrowers scammed into taking loans to at least 150 for profit online schools. After the AG settlement, didn't Navient also get out of the Federal student loan business due to scrutiny from lawmakers and borrower advocates? Didn't Navient have to pay restitution to the Federal student loan borrowers for not informing students of IDR/IBR payments students could have enrolled in, but instead steered toward forbearance? Furthermore, hasn't Navient been sued at least a half dozen times for other predatory loan practices and illegal collection practices? 
I am also aware of a "" pilot '' program by which Navient is sending out "" applications '' to select students who may have filed Borrower Defense claims against their schools and were approved.

09/21/24,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"I borrowed from Sallie Mae {$120000.00} between XXXX to pay for my studies and living expenses. After my graduation in XXXX I called for help, asking for options that could lower my payments from {$1000.00} to {$500.00} but, the only option I was given was forbearance. 

Later, my loans were transferred to Navient and the same issue continued. No one offered me help to lower my payments. From {$1000.00} my payments increased to {$2100.00} per month. From the beginning, Navient knew that I am struggling to find a job in my field because it is highly competitive profession. For every position there is between XXXX and XXXX applicants. For now, I am XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  while I search for a better job. My yearly income is below {$9.00}, XXXX. Everything I make goes towards paying Navient loans. 

When I called again asking for help, explaining that I am unable to pay such a high amount, and asking for options that would lower the payment to {$500.00}, I was told it was not possible. Finally, I was offered a XXXX XXXX XXXX which brought the amount between {$900.00} and {$1100.00}. I was on this program from XXXX to the end of XXXX until, I was told that I no longer qualify for the program. 

When I called again asking for help, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX told me that there is nothing that could be done for me, my only option to lower my payment is Interest Only Program. I was on this program from XXXX until I cancelled it on XXXX, XXXX XXXX because I realized that I was making payments of {$1200.00} but they did not reflect on my loans. I did not know for what I was paying. To this decision Navient threatened me that if I cancel before the program ends, then they would never enrol me on any of their programs again because I do not appear serious. 

Finally, to help me pay off a portion of my loan my parents, who are retired seniors, took out a loan and in XXXX, XXXX we were able to pay in full three loans out of nine. But this did not ease the burden. Navient still demands that I pay {$2000.00} monthly, and they keep raising the interest. Now it is at 15 %. 

When I called Navient on XX/XX/XXXX, I have spoken with XXXX and the manager. I asked her for help, explained my financial situation, and that I am struggling. Also, I confronted her why are my monthly payments so outrageous. The more I pay the more outrageous my payments become. To that she replied that I should work more and cut all my expenses. Which I already did for the past 14 yrs. I can not even afford to have a cell phone or a car, and everything I make goes towards paying Navient. Then she suggested that the only thing she could do for me is to put me on the XXXX XXXX XXXX again, which would bring my payment to XXXX $ per month. Which is still a huge burden for my family. 

Therefore, up until XX/XX/XXXX, together with my parents, we were making those large payments. But every time I checked my Navient account the amount of my loans did not change. Instead, they kept growing and the payments kept growing. All the payments that I made I do not know where they went. Everything is very confusing. When I called Navient asking why I do not see any change, no one gave me a clear answer. I was only told that it is their system of payment, it does not get lower but grows like a ladder. 

Also, throughout all these years, Navient used fraudulent tactics in order to make me pay extra charges and blame me for delinquency or they would withdraw more money than what was agreed on. 

For example, ever since I have been in repayment, I was set up on an automatic payment. Each month Navient was supposed to withdraw 2 payments from our family account I split the due amount in two parts, to be taken out at different dates of the month, as it helped to reduce the burden of a big amount taken at once. Instead Navient was withdrawing between XXXX to 6 times per month. 

For example, in XX/XX/XXXX, I was supposed to pay {$870.00} but they withdrew {$1400.00}. In XX/XX/XXXX, I was supposed to pay {$900.00} per month but Navient withdrew {$1500.00}. And there are many more months like that. Other times Navient would skip a payment and it looked as if I was behind on my payments. Immediately they would start harassing me that my loans were in delinquency, and that I need to pay a certain amount to bring it current. Throughout all these years I could not fix this problem. Each time I confronted Navient that they should stop doing it, I was told that it was the system failure and they will fix it. It would stop for some months but, then it would repeat again. 
Furthermore, when I wanted to find out the total amount that I have paid for my loans since XXXX, this information was nowhere to be found on my Navient account. The only amount that is shown is the balance and nothing else. When I called Navient in XXXX, XXXX asking why it is not available, XXXX told me that she does not know why and this information has to be requested. Why does it have to be requested? It has to be directly stated on our account for us to see. 

When I finally received my payment history from Navient it confirmed that I already paid in full what I owed and even more. I already paid {>= $1,000,000}. However, Navient claims that I still owe them {$110000.00}. Where is this amount coming from? I did not borrow this much. This is why I am asking CFPB for help. For fourteen years I have been treated unfairly. My family suffered undue hardship while paying my loans.

Several issues have come to light, including : Inaccurate Information : I have received misleading or incorrect information about their loan terms, repayment options, and eligibility for relief related to school misconduct. 

Mismanagement of Accounts : There are reports of improper application of payments and mismanagement of accounts, which have led to unnecessary financial strain on borrowers. 

Lack of Support for Misconduct Claims : Despite evidence of school misconductsuch as false advertising or breach of contractborrowers have struggled to receive appropriate remedies or discharges from Navient.

3. I've reached out to Navient for years about this and they stated it was nothing they could do about it. Never advised me of the "" School Misconduct Form ''. I request this form 3 times and they never sent it. I had to XXXX the form in effort to obtain it.

I am almost in default as I can not make the payment and the balance in not going down at all. When I got the loan I was told there would only be 3 % interest on the life of the loan, only to find out not the interest rate changes.

As a matter of fact, XXXX  was investigated by 49 state attorneys general and were found to be lying about total costs, accreditation, and were also investigated for distorted program costs and job placement rates and giving admission recruiters bonuses for getting more students to sign up.

However, by the time both loans were sent to be refinanced and consolidated, both loan balances were over {$31000.00} each. The total increase in the amount that I was originally told my education would cost is over {$18000.00} higher due to the undisclosed interest rate of 18.125 % ; which was compounding daily while I was in school. It was this incredibly high and criminal interest rate and a monthly payment of over {$1100.00} per month, when I was making {$10.00} as a line cook, forced me to refinance in XXXX. It was this refinance that prompted Navient to respond to my request for a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX with a denial.

When I originally applied, I was informed that the school was an accredited institution and that if I chose to pursue a higher degree, that the classes were eligible for transfer. 
Because of the numerous claims of fraud and misconduct perpetrated by these for-profit schools, such as XXXX, I was able to file a Borrower Defense claim as a full class member, with the Dept. of Education against XXXX however , the entirety of my loans were XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ( {$67000.00} ), and therefore did not qualify for Borrower Defense resulting in a denial of discharge and/or credit repair. 
I am aware that Navient was sued by 49 state AGs regarding their predatory loans to attend these online for-profit schools and that Sallie Mae/Navient were a "" preferred '' lending company in a "" deal '' with these schools during the early XXXX 's. These private loans with a high risk of default were part of a package deal offered to "" for profit schools ''. But loans made to students in states outside of the agreement, or those who were not in default for 7 months or more during a "" specific '' time frame, were excluded. I am sure this was a big win for Navient, but what a sham of a settlement deal for the rest of borrowers scammed into taking loans to at least 150 for profit online schools. After the AG settlement, didn't Navient also get out of the Federal student loan business due to scrutiny from lawmakers and borrower advocates? Didn't Navient have to pay restitution to the Federal student loan borrowers for not informing students of IDR/IBR payments students could have enrolled in, but instead steered toward forbearance? Furthermore, hasn't Navient been sued at least a half dozen times for other predatory loan practices and illegal collection practices?

I am also aware of a "" pilot '' program by which Navient is sending out "" applications '' to select students who may have filed Borrower Defense claims against their schools and were approved. This application is a sham. Why do we need to prove anything? Navient knows who we are. Under the FTC "" Holder Rule '' Navient is liable for giving predatory loans in connection with online for-profit schools. Time is running out for Navient to do right by students who were scammed into taking out private loans to attend online for profit colleges who have committed misconduct and misrepresented themselves to the public to entice students to enroll.

Upon reviewing my account, I discovered that Navient had marked my loan as 60 days overdue. I promptly contacted Navient to rectify this error, as I am no longer legally bound to repay this debt due to the protections afforded to me by the Consent Judgment issued by the state of New Jersey. Despite my explanation, Navients representatives incorrectly insisted that I was mistaken and continued to insist on repayment. 

Throughout our conversation, Navients representatives made false and misleading assertions, claiming that I was ineligible for debt relief because the loan did not meet the necessary criteria, including a lack of seven consecutive missed payments. These claims were not only untrue but also intentionally deceptive. 

According to the Final Consent Judgment, Navient committed to canceling certain private student loans, provided they met one of three specified criteria. My loan falls under Category 3, the Non-Traditional criterion, which includes loans disbursed to borrowers with a FICO score below XXXX at the time of origination for attendance at a public or private non-profit educational institution. 

At the time of my loans origination by Navient, my FICO score was indeed below XXXX, and I was enrolled in a public educational institution, thus qualifying for forgiveness. 
Moreover, Navients official disclosures state that loans are written off after 120 days of delinquency. Contrary to this policy, my credit report indicates that my loan was delinquent for seven months without being charged off. This discrepancy not only demonstrates a failure to adhere to their stated policies but also constitutes a significant misrepresentation in their financial statements regarding their charge-off timeline. 

The combination of Navients falsehoods, misleading statements, and unwarranted demands for payment constitutes a blatant breach of the Final Consent Judgment.",None,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",NJ,08610,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,08/01/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,9683525

Thousands of students were scammed by Navient into taking out predatory private loans to attend for profit online schools such as the one I attended, XXXX ( XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ). As a matter of fact, XXXX has been sued numerous times over their fraudulent practices.

These private loans with a high risk of default were part of a package deal offered to "" for profit online schools ''. But loans made to students in states outside of the agreement, or those who were not in default for 7 months or more during a "" specific '' time frame, were excluded. I am sure this was a big win for Navient, but what a sham of a settlement deal for the rest of borrowers scammed into taking loans to at least 150 for profit online schools. After the AG settlement, didn't Navient also get out of the Federal student loan business due to scrutiny from lawmakers and borrower advocates? Didn't Navient have to pay restitution to the Federal student loan borrowers for not informing students of IDR/IBR payments students could have enrolled in, but instead steered toward forbearance?

Despite having paid the total amount towards these loans, my current balance is paid off in full while ahead of the amount of time given to pay it back. 
Notably, XXXX XXXX XXXX and their parent company, XXXX, were subject to investigations by various state attorneys general and found to have engaged in deceptive practices. In response to widespread allegations of fraud and misconduct by XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, the Biden administration recently announced a comprehensive loan discharge for students enrolled at these institutions from XX/XX/XXXX, to XX/XX/XXXX. This led to the discharge of my federal loans totaling about XXXX and the restoration of my credit. 
Navient, which was sued by the attorneys general of 39 states for its role in facilitating these predatory loans, had a specific arrangement with for-profit schools during the early XXXX, makin~ it a "" preferred '' lender. Despite this, the settlement terms provided by Navient were considerably inadequate, excluding many borrowers who took loans for attendance at approximately XXXX for-profit online schools, unless they resided in certain states or had not defaulted for at least seven months during a specified period. 
The only period during which I managed to reduce the principal amount was during the pandemic, when interest rates were temporarily lowered to between 0.5 % and 1 %. However, once the regular interest rates resumed, my balance skyrocketed again. This financial strain, coupled with the emotional stress and damage to personal relationships, has been overwhelming. 
Moreover, Navient exited the federal student loan servicing business amidst legislative and advocacy scrutiny, following allegations of steering borrowers away from income-driven repayment plans towards forbearance, an action for which they had to provide restitution. 
Navient has also faced multiple lawsuits for other predatory lending and illegal collection practices. 
Currently, Navient is distributing "" applications '' to select students who may qualify for Borrower Defense claims against their schools. However, this process feels unnecessary and opaque, as Navient is already aware of the affected students.

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX and all XXXX  schools are now permanently closed as part of XXXX XXXX ongoing litany of accreditation issues and lawsuits, XXXX 's predatory practices and exploitive partnerships with Sallie Mae / Navient and to whom I made all payments from XXXX. The impacts still reverberate and haunt me and my family to this day. My mom XXXX, has delayed retirement for fear of late-life financial harms being that she is the co-signer on ALL of the private loans and has been the payer on as many as were possible over the last 15 years. She carries immense guilt for her trusting the recruiters when we sat down with them in fall XXXX. Their misconducts were known publicly as early as XXXX ( one year after going into repayment ) when uncovered as a result of exhaustive investigations, depositions, and lawsuits and findingd presented in United States Senate HEALTH, EDUCATION, LABOR AND PENSIONS COMMITTEE For Profit Higher Education : The Failure to Safeguard the Federal Investment and Ensure Student Success in XXXX of XXXX. We have to date paid upwards of {$110000.00} on loans that were originally half, if that in the neighborhood of $ XXXX, at the time of borrowing - you can find the payments attached, downloaded directly from Navient 's site on the life of the loans to affirm this fact and .xls spreadsheets that provide greater detail, but XXXX  clarity on the silent killer that is the *capitalized* interest. I have thrown huge sums and even windfalls that would have been circumstance changing at these debts over the years- $ XXXX, $ XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX payments where I could to chop at the interest accruing balance. It's all there in the records attached. 

Evidence of all of these acts can be be found in the Senate Committee On Health Education and Labor report on higher education, in the Testimony of XXXX XXXX XXXX. Truly, in reading this report - I was first shocked, then saddened, then angered - because of the time lost, the mental, emotional, and most harmful - financial cost. Worst even, that cost did not just fall on me. As youth hoping to outrun college completion statistics, my family was completely invested in providing the only manner of support they could, which was not liquid cash but more XXXX-pushed loans. 3 generations of my family have poured into XXXX XXXXNavient/Sallie Mae . My grand parents ( grandfather a Korean War veteran and in his latter years a tailor at XXXX XXXX, my grandmother a XXXX XXXX XXXX ), my mother- a XXXX XXXX  who at the time wholly believed in the virtues of higher education and the implied integrity of school staff and officials, and myself- XXXX at the time informed but unaware of the coy and explicit ways in which I was being manipulated into a financial yoke that would haunt me year, after year, after year, after year to follow. That school is now shuttered as listed on their closed school information page - as it should be- though it has taken harm to many people for that to happen. XXXX XXXX XXXX  Much of this was brought to bear primarily due to misrepresentation of cost and transferability of credits and later exacerbated by predatory lending, mismanagement of my account loan accounts, and self-serving allocations of payments made by Sallie Mae and Navient XXXX My original intention when I met with XXXX admissions recruiters in Fall of XXXX was that I would attend my first year or so as a cost-saving measure until I could transfer to my primary choice to which I was accepted w/o financial aid - XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX - where my family is from and most resided at the time- but have incurred out of state tuition fees I couldn't afford due to having applied from XXXX  The recruiter harped repeatedly on their lack of out-of-state costs and the savings available and provided many assurances of transferability of credits both into and out of the institution, which I later uncovered to be an outright lie. She made no mention of the ongoing accreditation issues XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX was facing that would make transfer prohibitive if not remedied. This misrepresentation ultimately resulted in an inability to continue due to mounting costs and inability to transfer ( which would have saved me and my family money after establishing 1 year of residency ). Meaning I would have to stay, pay, and attempt to finish despite cost at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX -- XXXX. It eventually became unsustainable. Once into repayment I was constantly hounded despite the school not making good on its job placement promises and artificially inflated placement numbers. Sallie Mae and Navient representatives called me and my mom, and grandparents tirelessly but failed to provide proper information on my options, leading to non-beneficial amounts being paid by all of us, and at other times when it couldn't be paid, putting me and the loans into extremely costly forbearances that I would later learn had capitalized into principle. Insuring more cost and higher interest. Navient is named as an active and willing participant in practices that were found to be profoundly unethical and predatory and their harm was docuemnted in the Navient AG Multi-State Settlement. 


BELOW ARE A LIST OF DETAILED INTERACTIONS WITH AI AND THE ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF ART BY PREDATORY TACTIC : Pressured were aggressive and deceptive- recruiter pressured and played on my feelings of failure and stagnation that I had revealed during my initial sit-down- I was consistently pressured to apply for financial aid but never informed that I could decline the acceptance of the awarded aid Misrepresented - cost, employability, completion and job placements- They reiterated these talking points time and again ; first in our sit down chat in the ai admin offices, then again in their printed promotional materials, and again online and in subsequent phone and email communications- Substantially misrepresented true cost ( that while the first year would indeed be slightly less expensive than my other option, tuition would stay the same and even increase in subsequent years, making it categorically far more expensive than my other option ) but they touted post grad job placement which my other option did not - They aggressively pushed federal student loans as an option when I was hesitant and then played on my moms concerns, pushing her into parent plus loans with cost and interest that in her then state of employment were far beyond her means. 
- I was very clear that though I had read the disorganized array of loan materials they shared, I wasnt all the way clear on implications and very earnestly stated I was reliant on their expertise and their stated care for student outcomes - When I said I wanted to circle back so that I could talk with my mom or other trusted sources who had taken loans themselves, I was discouraged and roped into longer and guilty-laden conversation - They also assured me that previous credits earned at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX would transfer, which I also reasonably expected because they were basic first year general studies courses- they did not. And of course this incurred more cost- Beyond that the recruiters and student counselors routinely made substantially misleading statements to me with regard to transferability of credits post AI. Since I made it clear that I wanted to attend for my first possibly second year, then transfer to my school of choice. 
- However, after some time and research as that date neared, I found that my credits did not indeed transfer to XXXX and that I had to either lose my credits earned in the prior 18 mos or stay and complete my education at XXXX. The counselor at the time harped heavily on guilt and fear of failure - reminding me of the time I had already lost in my previous transfer from out of state. In hindsight, I felt this was coercive and deliberate to keep me enrolled as evidenced in the attached affidavit and Senate committee report.

- I stayed, however, this resulted in my first of many depressive episodes that precipitated a steep decline in my grades, a sense of hopelessness and loss that at 20 was indescribable and masked by heightened emotions and youth. 
- They also misrepresented data on their post graduation successful placement rate stating it was very high, where later litigation in fact shows total knowledge of these falsehoods and well as encouragement by managers to obfuscate the true numbers in favor of increasing enrollment in a sales type manor. More concerned with admission and enrollment than educational outcome- The school operated both a gallery and a restaurant called XXXX XXXX ( later changed to XXXX )- where they employed programmed students and counted them in their placements and employment stats ( page 4 of the attached doc ) Omitted - true statistics on student rates of completion, as well as, true cost ( that while the first year would indeed be slightly less expensive than my other option, tuition would stay the same and even increase in subsequent years, making it categorically far more expensive than my other option ) but they touted post grad job placement which my other option did not There was never any mention of potential or ongoing accreditation issues at that campus or any of its sister campus and institutions this would have immediately raised a red flag - When XX/XX/XXXX - How it impacted my decision to attend and take out financial aid - The detriment I suffered is that I never completed my education - having to withdraw due to cost and poor performance related to having to work so much to supplement cost and it haunts me to this day, impacts my confidence because Im plagued by XXXX XXXX  I took a series of whatever I could get jobs, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX I quit without safetynet or options.

04/24/24,Student loan,Private student loan,Struggling to repay your loan,Problem lowering your monthly payments,"I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to seek urgent assistance regarding my student loans with Navient, which have become an overwhelming burden over the years. 

Since XX/XX/2009, I have diligently made payments on over 7 private loans with Navient, totaling nearly 15 years of continuous repayment. Regrettably, despite these efforts, the structure of my loan payments appears to have disproportionately favored smaller, lower interest rate loans, leaving my higher interest loans largely untouched. 

Of utmost concern are my two largest loans with Navient : one amounting to {$28000.00} at a staggering interest rate of 14.5 %, and another totaling {$14000.00}, also at 14.5 %. The disparity between the original principal amounts and the accrued interest is deeply distressing. For instance, my largest loan initially bore a principal of {$12000.00}, yet the accumulated interest has ballooned to an astonishing {$30000.00}. Similarly, the second largest loan, originating at {$10000.00}, has accrued a daunting {$12000.00} in interest. 

As a single mother without external support, the financial strain imposed by these loans has become unbearable. Despite my persistent efforts, the outstanding balance remains insurmountable, compounded by relentless communication from Navient during periods of financial hardship. 

I am reaching out in desperation, seeking guidance on potential avenues for relief or renegotiation of these exorbitant interest rates. The current terms render the prospect of loan repayment unfeasible, and I am left questioning whether I have already repaid the principal borrowed, now struggling under the weight of accrued interest. 

Your expertise and support in navigating this distressing situation would be immensely appreciated. Please advise on any available resources or strategies that could assist in alleviating this financial burden. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I eagerly await your response and remain hopeful for a positive resolution.

But they still somehow ended up at my address even though it should have been returned by the postal service due to them knowing very well the address they used that was wrong. But you know how it goes. People fond it difficult to be ethical, moral, selfless. So they do out of spite retaliation. Navient has always found my number even though I have previously had changed it a couple different times then, then just let it go because I caught on to their pattern and realize they have some sort of insight and able to pay their way into getting my information somehow. It is what it is. I figured, so why keep changing it if they are going to get it anyway? They have been doing this to me since around XXXX to the present. They know very well how long they have been basically stalking and harassing me but using their protection of we are allowed to call because it is an debt. I very well understand that but what I dont understand is how they always ended up with my number. That is no coincidence and can be proven. Anyway to this day in XXXX they still are in their same cycle and using it is an debt and we are allowed to call you. Basically rubbing it in my face they know they are just being dishonest, unethical, immoral corrupt, narcissistic abusers. Research it, mainly narcissistic abusers do stuff like this to their victims to gain response out of us so they can get their jollies off. They abuse their power, authority, and privileges and the control of peoples lives. They pay out large amounts of money to basically never take accountability and they keep doing the same negligent, unethical, immoral narcissistic abuser bully tactics and hiding their hands. They all know what they are doing and its disgusting. They use the Overseas call center due to they can break the rules and not have to comply. Why am I getting contact/communication from NAVIENT XXXX when I am Onshore and stateside? Its due to the difference in culture and understanding is why. They brainwash those foreign reps and use their vessels to carry out the Navient dirty deeds. Lots of companies are doing this and it keeps customers from trying to resolve conflict. Its an psychology behind it all. All to keep their energy tied to us so we never forget them. And they always stay in control knowing no matter what you do to try to ignore and block them they will crookedly pay for access to continue the cycle. Why do I say this? Picture this A month ago was your last on phone conversation request for them to stop calling. And to send via mail. They somewhat comply, and I got the communication via mail. Get this though, you have all calls forwarded but somehow just out of the blue your call forwarding was XXXX and you never touched your phone and someone called through and left you an voicemail. This is all highly organized operation these folks are pulling off. See what a-lot of money and status and power against others gets people/corporations? Gives them the upper hand to do their unethical, immoral, dishonest, corrupt, narcissistic abuse and retaliation. Again no coincidence being my last real conversation was from Navient. So I resolved that and activated for basically an whole rest of the month up till today. I looked last night and the number I forwarded it to had been altered and the area code changed but the rest of the number remained. ( I did complete an test call when I XXXX  activated it again after it mysteriously turned off and someone left me an voicemail ( fake fraud I located them and their location via their number and their XXXX XXXX accounts ) I went ahead and just cleared my phone and turned off my call forwarding. Low and behold an Missed call From Navient XXXX thing this morning. Again that is no coincidence. Ive got so much documentation and numbers that can be linked together and help figure out all involved in my situation I have endured for quite some time now. They are dirty, corrupt, dishonest, unethical, immoral, selfish, narcissistic abusers. And they need to stop hounding people about debts from back in XXXX. They know they have been doing this to me for an very, very, very, long time. And it needs to stop. They keep on and on and on and and trying to flip it back onto me as an aggressor when its them that keeps calling me after I block their many numbers in which I have all written down and documented. I guarantee, you make them call me from some of those numbers I blocked and they will prove to show they are blocked and they just keep making new numbers and doing the same ole mess. Trying to force manifest their ill intentions and plot and story line onto me so they remain with their hands and faces hidden. Ive reported this to FTC and FCC. And I did my check and my number has been registered to the Government do not call list since XXXX, XXXX. XXXX or so. I just checked my verification email. It is what it was is. They are corrupt and need to all kneel down in the corner on their knees on plates of rice. Then take their accountability and punishment for taking it way too far with their retaliation and abuse implementations and tactics. Im tired of these jerks attacking my spirit and soul and get away smooth and continue The cycle because they never get called out or caught. Thank you for your time.

Because of the numerous claims of fraud and misconduct perpetrated by The XXXX XXXX, the Biden administration has just announced a blanket discharge for anyone enrolled at XX/XX/XXXX from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. 
My Federal loans in the amount of ( Your amount here ) were discharged and my credit repaired. 

I am aware that Navient was sued by 39 state AGs regarding their predatory loans to attend these online for-profit schools and that Sallie Mae/Navient were a "" preferred '' lending company in a "" deal '' with these schools during the early XXXX 's. 

These private loans with a high risk of default were part of a package deal offered to "" for profit online schools '', but loans made to students in states outside of the agreement, or those who were not in default for 7 months or more during a "" specific '' time frame, were excluded. 

I am sure this was a big win for Navient, but what a sham of a settlement deal for the rest of borrowers scammed into taking loans to at least XXXX for profit online schools. 
After the AG settlement, didn't Navient also get out of the Federal student loan business due to scrutiny from lawmakers and borrower advocates?

Didn't Navient have to pay restitution to the Federal student loan borrowers for not informing students of IDR/IBR payments students could have enrolled in, but instead steered toward forbearance? 

Furthermore, hasn't Navient been sued at least a half dozen times for other predatory loan practices and illegal collection practices? 

I am also aware of a "" pilot '' program by which Navient is sending out "" applications '' to select students who may have filed Borrower Defense claims against their schools and were approved.

This application is a sham.

Navient knows who we are.

Under the FTC "" Holder Rule '' Navient is liable for giving predatory loans in connection with online for-profit schools.

06/05/24,Student loan,Private student loan,Struggling to repay your loan,Problem lowering your monthly payments,"XXXX XXXX, I am writing to share my concerns with Navient, the services of my private student loan that I took out in XXXX to attend college. 

Since graduating in XXXX, I have consistently made my payments until recently due to financial hardship, both due to a loss of income and due to XXXX. My account is now delinquent, and I have made multiple attempts to contact Navient to adjust my payments to lower them or to extend my term giving me the ability to manage my health and wellbeing. Instead, I am consistently harassed by Navient, having received calls daily and sometimes multiple times a day. Additionally, these calls are made by people working from home across the country, so I was getting unidentified or unlisted calls which I avoided because I did not know legitimacy of the call. 


I am a XXXX XXXX with diagnosed XXXX, for which I have been trying to manage for 10 years. My original loan of {$17000.00} currently has a balance of {$20000.00}, for which I have already paid similar amount over the last 10 years. While I went to college for XXXX XXXX, I was unable to go into the field due to the paying of jobs and need for further education and instead went into another field. In these 10 years, I have made good faith efforts to pay my monthly payment and it was not until recently in the last year that I struggled, after changing XXXX  due to XXXX  in my XXXX for my XXXX and the challenges affecting my XXXX. 

I reached out to Navient, who placed me on a modified payment plan to lower the interest for 6 months, which at the end only increased my monthly payment even more. I applied again, and it dropped it only minor, and I struggled so for the past couple months have been unable to pay. 

I have shared with Navient that I am trying to pay for a XXXX XXXX for my XXXX, so this large monthly payment which only increases, drastically impacts my ability to address my health. I have been told that I am already on a plan, so I can not be put on any other. I have received harassing phone calls, often multiple times a day. When I shared I already spoke with someone, they said it wasnt reported. When I shared I physically could not pay, they marked it as me refusing to which I argued that I was not refusing, I just was not able to. I was told by a manager that I spoke with over the numerous calls that they can call as many times as they want in a day or week, even if they already spoke with me. 


I took out this loan to attend school, however it was a private loan that was sent directly to me and not the institution and covered more than the cost of attendance being used to cover other expenses at the time. I went into it knowing I would need to make payments, and over the last 10 years I have ensured my payments were received even when I was only paid monthly and dealing with other life events or the challenges of my XXXX. The harassing phone calls when I was unable to make a payment initially for the first time was so overwhelming. The multiple phone calls from unidentified numbers, from multiple different numbers and area codes. Calls while I am working. I have asked for options to make it more affordable, especially since I have already made paid back the total of original loan but owning double. But these come at a cost, because then the payments increase above the original amount I was paying, putting me even further behind which is where I currently am. 


As I have explained to Navient, I have a XXXX and am currently trying to afford just to go to XXXX  and get a XXXX XXXX which is expensive and then requires additional money for the care of XXXX XXXX. I have explained that I am basically needing to decide between my health or a loan payment that only increases. Still they continue to harass me with phone calls despite sharing I am unable to pay at this time. They say they can just keep calling, and it affects my health even more. There is no reason I should be getting calls every day, after having a conversation with them to explain my hardship, or to get multiple phone calls a day. The calls should be clearly identified as someone calling from Navient, and I should not be getting calls while at work or for them to tell me they can call however many times that they want to to collect. 


I never asked to be attacked and have this XXXX. I have had a difficult 10 years just being able to survive, and finally when I am trying to take the steps to live a better life, I am shackled by a company who has consistently raised interest rates or my monthly payment after helping. A hardship payment plan, should not mean after 6 months that they increase the monthly amount. 

When I removed my bank from Navient for the automatic payment, they still proceeded to charge my bank despite me having removed them from my account online. 

Yesterday, I got another call and shared I could not make payment with information above. Hour later I got an email that I had a payment scheduled, for which I called them and said I never scheduled a payment and that I shared I could not pay. 

This is not the first time that Navient has failed. Back in XXXX when they serviced my federal student loans- I was paying two payments a month for my subsidized and unsubsidized loans. I was contacted by them to lower my payment under the income driven repayment plan, which did help because instead of making two payments, I made one and it was about half overall. However, I then learned only AFTER consolidating them, that it restarted my PSLF qualification for those loans, eliminating all the months I had already made payments. I was then told there was nothing that could be done- and this further extended the timeline for me to pay these down with me having two more years. 

I need the CFPB to address the harassment of Navient calls, as well as their deceptive practices. They intentionally document a refusal to pay, despite trying to work out hardship or payment structure, and even then will schedule payments and authorize them even if removed. I understand fully my obligation and commitment I made to pay this, however at a time where my health is struggling and needing assistance, the harassing phone calls, failure to properly document, and increased payments after hardship plan has ended does not help. If a hardship plan is provided to assist, it should not be later increased as that is not a true good faith effort on their end.",None,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",FL,326XX,None,Consent provided,Web,06/05/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,9180513
06/27/24,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"In XXXX of XXXX, I contacted Navient to inform that I no longer was employed and wanted to setup a new payment plan. I informed them that I was receiving unemployment and government assistance. They refused to assist me with the matter. In XXXX of XXXX, I received my tax refund, and made a payment arrangement with them to get caught up. The customer service representative I spoke with informed me that my next payment would not be due until XXXX of XXXX 

In late XXXX of XXXX  I began receiving calls that my payment was now due. Between XX/XX/year> and XXXX of XXXX, I verbally asked Navient to verify the billing information with me and review the call from XXXX of XXXX. Every phone call was met with the promise that a supervisor would reach out to me, after they reviewed the call, and I assured them that once the billing was confirmed that I would make the payment. 

After a call on XX/XX/year>, I decided to submit a written inquiry about the billing request and issues. 

Navient waited until after the 60 day mark to respond and reported delinquency to the credit bureaus. 

I have requested for them to remove that marking from my credit report because according to the law, 15 U.S. Code 1666 - Correction of billing errors, I had the right to verify the debt, without penalty.

According to the law, 15 U.S. Code 1666 ( 3 ) sets forth the reasons for the obligors belief ( to the extent applicable ) that the statement contains a billing error, the creditor shall, unless the obligor has, after giving such written notice and before the expiration of the time limits herein specified, agreed that the statement was correct ( A ) not later than thirty days after the receipt of the notice, send a written acknowledgment thereof to the obligor, unless the action required in subparagraph ( B ) is taken within such thirty-day period, and ( B ) not later than two complete billing cycles of the creditor ( in no event later than ninety days ) after the receipt of the notice and prior to taking any action to collect the amount, or any part thereof, indicated by the obligor under paragraph ( 2 ) either ( i ) make appropriate corrections in the account of the obligor, including the crediting of any finance charges on amounts erroneously billed, and transmit to the obligor a notification of such corrections and the creditors explanation of any change in the amount indicated by the obligor under paragraph ( 2 ) and, if any such change is made and the obligor so requests, copies of documentary evidence of the obligors indebtedness ; or ( ii ) send a written explanation or clarification to the obligor, after having conducted an investigation, setting forth to the extent applicable the reasons why the creditor believes the account of the obligor was correctly shown in the statement and, upon request of the obligor, provide copies of documentary evidence of the obligors indebtedness. In the case of a billing error where the obligor alleges that the creditors billing statement reflects goods not delivered to the obligor or his designee in accordance with the agreement made at the time of the transaction, a creditor may not construe such amount to be correctly shown unless he determines that such goods were actually delivered, mailed, or otherwise sent to the obligor and provides the obligor with a statement of such determination.

The investigation not being completed before the 60 days violates the law, 15 U.S. Code 1666 and therefore should be removed from my credit report.",None,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",GA,XXXXX,None,Consent provided,Web,06/27/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,9363166

'' I would like to request a specific reason for this denial, as the response I received appears to be a generalized statement that was sent to numerous other applicants who were also denied. I provided substantial evidence in my application, including documentation of my approved Borrower 's Defense case against ITT Technical Institute for federal loans. My private loans pertain to the same institution and the same period as my federal loans, where widespread misconduct took place. 

I believe I have met the necessary criteria for discharge based on school misconduct, and I am seeking a detailed explanation as to why my application was denied. I would like to know what additional information or documents I can submit for reconsideration of this application.

07/17/24,Student loan,Private student loan,Getting a loan,Confusing or misleading advertising,"I attended the University XXXX XXXX  from XXXX  XXXX to Spring XXXX, when I graduated with my XXXX I was a community college transfer student in the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX The program was marketed as a prestigious opportunity for non-traditional students, particularly those from XXXX  colleges, to earn an XXXX XXXX degree. The advertisements emphasized inclusivity and the promise of support for low-income students. All over the XXXX  website were claims that low-income students would qualify for the no-loan financial aid program. However, it wasn't until I had already moved to XXXX and registered for classes that I was informed that the no-loan policy did not include students in the XXXX XXXX 

From one of the attached recruitment emails, "" As a XXXX student in thXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX you will have access to the same classes, the same faculty, the same classmates, the same resources, and the same diploma as the undergraduates who are taking a more traditional path. '' The financial strain caused by XXXX XXXX misleading practices had severe consequences for my family. My partner and I faced significant debt, causing immense stress and pushing us to the brink of XXXX. XXXX 's policies exacerbated our financial instability, undermining the dream of an XXXX XXXX education and placing a heavy burden on our household. The emotional and mental toll of this situation was profound, affecting our daily lives and well-being. 

I also experienced significant difficulty with the credit transfer process. As a first-generation college student, I had minimal support navigating this process. XXXX did not confirm which of my community college credits would be accepted until very late in the process. I had already turned down another university that accepted all my credits, believing XXXX XXXX  program offered a no-debt opportunity, only to face academic setbacks and added financial burdens due to the delayed and incomplete credit transfer process. 

I also had a negative experience with my private student loans. Misled into believing I qualified for XXXX 's no-loan policy, I was forced to take out substantial loans. My partner 's family had to co-sign these loans because my parents were unemployed. The pressure to accept these terms was intense, and I was led to believe it was my only option, resulting in a significant financial burden. The financial aid department at XXXX pushed me towards Sallie Mae, with staff members having connections with their representatives ( see attached emails ). Due to the high interest rates, I eventually refinanced through XXXX, part of the Navient/Sallie Mae family , which was absolutely necessary to manage the financial strain. The financial aid representative at XXXX that I reached out to put me in touch with her associate at Sallie Mae to help me navigate the situation. She thought they would be able to help me. This representative simply suggested that I refinance with XXXX when I could. 

I chose to attend XXXX over another four-year institution, lured by the promise of an XXXX XXXX XXXX and the supposed financial support for low-income students. This decision, influenced by misleading advertising, resulted in significant financial and academic challenges that I had not anticipated. This other institution accepted all of my other credits upon acceptance. Had I known that I was not going to be included in the no-loan program, I would not have gone to XXXX and would have been in a significantly better financial situation. The financial difficulties and the need to take out large private loans have negatively impacted my credit. I have experienced issues with credit reporting, making it difficult to secure financing for essential needs such as a car or a lease. The burden of debt has had a long-lasting effect on my financial stability and creditworthiness. 

I experienced numerous issues with the financial aid process, including pressure and misleading information. Unlike traditional undergraduates, XXXX  students received their financial aid packages on a rolling basis, creating uncertainty and stress. Critical information about the exclusion of XXXX  students from the no-loan policy was withheld until it was too late to reconsider my options, leading to significant financial strain. 

The recruitment tactics used by XXXX were aggressive and high-pressure. The program was portrayed as a beacon of hope for non-traditional students, using our stories to market diversity and inclusivity. However, the reality was starkly different, with XXXX  students excluded from the no-loan policy and facing significant financial and academic challenges. The misleading recruitment tactics lured me into a situation that was far from the supportive environment promised. 

My experience at the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  program was marked by misleading advertising, aggressive recruitment tactics, and significant financial and administrative challenges. The promises made during recruitment were not fulfilled, and the support for non-traditional students was grossly inadequate. This situation has had a profound impact on my life, leading to substantial debt, financial hardship, and negative effects on my credit. I believe I was misled and cheated by the XXXX XXXX XXXX and I am seeking legal support to address these grievances. Thank you for considering my case. 

I also recommend reading the following article where other students share similar experiences from around the time I graduated : https : XXXX Select quotes : - "" For XXXX, XXXX is his dream school but certain administrative and financial aid policies in XXXX have disappointed him and many other students who envisioned a more traditional XXXX experience. '' - My financial aid package is really not big enough and sometimes it is a struggle to keep up with paying rent and taking care of my family while taking out all these loans. 
- "" XXXX  lists four financing and payment options for XXXX  students on its website : loans, direct loans, direct PLUS loans and the XXXX monthly budget plan. Around XXXX percent of XXXX  students take out these loans, but for some students, it is still not enough.

07/30/24,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"In the mid to late XXXX, I attended the XXXX XXXX. My loans were all serviced by then Sallie-Mae , now Navient. After getting almost through the program, and realizing that I had yet to learn ( I was in the end of my third year ) anything related to the field I was trying to get a degree in, I parted ways from the school. I spent the next decade and some change struggling to pay my loans, going on income plans, seeking the various repayment plans offered, etc. Through it all, there was nothing Navient would do to lower the payments or whatever about the 2-3 private loans I had through them. So I had no choice but to pay the minimum.

Come this year, and the findings by the Federal justice system, the US Department of Education, that XXXX XXXX XXXX were basically running an elaborate fraud scheme, I started looking into my options. In regards to the two big private loans, one was initially for ~ {$6800.00}, and the other for ~ {$13000.00}. At this point, I'd paid the smaller one off ( the initial principle plus almost {$4700.00} in interest. ) and was most of the way done with the larger ( over the years, I'd paid all but about {$3500.00} off out of the {$13000.00} initial amount plus almost {$10000.00} in interest. ) Still, I wanted to be out from under it. 

Cue the beginnings of the long and arduous fight I've been dealing with since. 

First, I messaged Navient about if there were any options. It took a bit, but they sent me a vague email of "" Oh, there's this school misconduct app, check your navient inbox by clicking this link! '' Which I attempted, but the link was broken. 

THen I sent them another message, saying "" Hey, look, I got this response to my question, but where do I find the form. Your link is broken. '' The somewhat ugly response was "" Fill out the app provided in a previous email. '' Very unpleasant form letter that all but said the word "" XXXX  '' in it. Further attempts there got me nowhere. 

I ended up having to search via XXXX to find the application, and that took me to a XXXX XXXX that provided a link to a third party site because Navient was basically making this process as painful and impossible as they could. 

Then I filled out like ... .fourteen pages of application? I cited the specific loan numbers, the amounts, provided the Education Department "" Summary of Findings '' in regards to the school, and had to go into extensive detail about how the school defrauding me and them was... harmful. As if being in crippling, inescapable debt wasnt bad enough, they wanted all kinds of personal details about the experience. I told them what I could. I even pointed out that while I understood we were both defrauded by the school 's overblown and glorified ponzi scheme, the feds had determined what the school had done was... well. Fraudulent. That the Federal Government was going to be REIMBURSING the money paid off on Federal loans for those schools -- and given that the federal government can be pretty miserly with cash, that's huge -- and that it felt pretty shady the way this was being handled by Navient. ( Particularly since the feds had to bully them into even doing this much. ) I honestly wanted my loans wiped out ... and I asked for the ~ {$30000.00} back I had paid them over the decade. Or at least a good portion of it, because ... if it was fraud... then it was also theft. They paid the school, but they made way more off me than they lost to the school. 

I submitted the application. Got an email after a few days that they had gotten the application, and my loan was placed in forbearance for 60 days. Over the next few weeks, I received a ton of ads from them about personal loans and the like, but nothing on the application. Then I get a "" Your loans are going to be transferred to XXXX '' notice in my email. 

So I keep checking. Nothing has changed. 

This morning, XX/XX/XXXX, I check again ( I've checked a couple of nights a week since I submitted the application ). There, my loan has been updated -- what I owe has been "" Zeroed out '' with a rather interesting backdate of XX/XX/XXXX. But there's no correspondence, no email ( and yes, I checked all my spam folders ), and I've gotten nothing in the mail. In addition my account is still labeled as "" in forbearance '' for "" another 10 days. '' Given everything, it felt shady, so I used their "" Chat with us! '' button to get a person on chat. I really just wanted some kind of information. 

I was informed "" oh yes, your application seems to be going through the approval process '' and that "" oh, it takes a long time to process, so you'll get an email when its done. '' Okay, fair, I suppose, but really lousy customer service in a history of lousy customer service and shady actions ( Like not informing me ever when the interest rate on a loan changed -- sometimes by as much as 5 % from one month to the next, double dipping on taking money out of my account for monthly payments, etc. ). So I inquired if there was any chance of reimbursement on the money paid in to what was essentially a fraud scheme, and i was told "" Oh, well, no. No money will be refunded for payments made PRIOR to your misconduct application being submitted. '' Which ... .like... Let 's think about that. Why would I pay AFTER submitting the application? The whole point of it was to get the loan wiped out and seek reimbursement for the financial damage caused by what has been revealed to be a fraud scheme by a school and capitalized on by a predatory lending company -- in addition to the recent decision about XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX and other colleges like them, I found in my search today that NAVIENT/SALLIE MAE has already been brought up in the past for BEING PART OF THIS WHOLE SCHEME -- there was a case in 2022 that revealed internal memos and stuff about how they were basically preying on people with these loans and fully expected people to default, refused to offer repayment plans, yo-yo-ing interest rates , the whole thing.

I informed the person at Navient I was talking to that I would appreciate documentation of all of this, and that at this point, I would be reporting the company for fraudulent behavior, theft, shady business practices, and seeking legal options for this.

At the end of the day, I'm one person, and they've made almost twice as much from me as they paid to the "" school '' I attended. For them, $ XXXX is probably chump change... but for me thats a year 's income BEFORE taxes.

And they service millions of borrowers. There were thousands of people from the schools that the ED found guilty of this fraud scheme. If they're like me, then thats millions of dollars that Navient has STOLEN and DEFRAUDED from every day people.

More information can also be found at Navient.com '' However, according to The Project on Predatory Student Lending, there was no mention that the school has to be a for profit school only to qualify for the school misconduct application only if you felt that you were a victim of a predatory school. I attended a nonprofit university. Just because the University is a non-profit university, that does not mean they did not conspire with XXXX XXXXNavient to conspire to deceive me into predatory loan and I should be provided the chance to challenge my Navient student loan and feel that Navient is preventing me in doing so by withholding me an application. I hope that this complaint will help lead to the result that I need to challenge this wrongdoing.

In XXXX, I did send an email to XXXX asking about the discharges and they told me to reach out to Federal Student Aid - I sent an email to the Ombudsman for this information. 

On XX/XX/XXXX - I received an updated payment schedule from XXXX showing a principal {$62000.00}. There was no reason why the amount changed to verify this was related to the anticipated Borrower Defense discharge and the XXXX website only showed "" refund ''. The customer service agent could not provide me any additional information. At this time the student aid website still showed the $ XXXX loans.

I received a response telling me to export from transaction history ( which did not provide the information I wanted, which is why I reached out to them originally ). 

XX/XX/XXXX - received monthly statement with updated payment of {$380.00}. Because my payment was now based of $ XXXX, this was also expected due to Borrower Defense. 

Here is where my problem starts coming in. 

On XX/XX/XXXX. I received a notice from Navient that a forbearance document was available for me advising my payments would resume on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX Since my two loans are serviced through XXXX, this is very confusing.

I am writing to dispute the validity and accuracy of my student loan, specifically concerning [ Loan Account Number ]. According to my research and understanding of relevant laws, I believe there are grounds to challenge the loan on the following bases : 1. Violation of the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) : I contend that the loan agreement provided by your institution did not adequately disclose all the relevant terms and conditions of the loan. This violates the requirements set forth in the TILA, which mandates lenders to provide clear and transparent information to borrowers. 



2. Failure to Provide Required Disclosures : I have not received certain mandatory disclosures as mandated by the Department of Education and other applicable laws. These include but are not limited to the total cost of the loan, annual percentage rate ( APR ), and repayment terms. 



3. Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : I have reason to believe that the loan has been inaccurately reported to credit bureaus, negatively impacting my creditworthiness. This potential violation of the FCRA raises concerns about the accuracy and integrity of the loan information on my credit reports. 



4. Lack of Verification of Debt : Pursuant to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), I request verification of the debt in question. I expect you to provide detailed documentation that validates the existence, amount, and ownership of the loan. 



5. Potential Statute of Limitations : I am exploring the possibility that the statute of limitations on this debt may have expired. If that is the case, pursuing collection activities on this loan would be in violation of the applicable laws. 





Additionally, I reserve my right to seek legal counsel and take further action to protect my rights under the law if these matters are not adequately addressed. 



I look forward to your prompt attention to this matter and a resolution that upholds the principles of fairness and compliance with applicable laws. Please acknowledge receipt of this letter by mail or email.

My application was denied stating that I did not meet criteria to have my loans discharged. I contacted Navient about getting a better explanation of the criteria that I did not meet.

I currently owe Navient about {$83000.00} in XXXX XXXX XXXX, accrued as a result of my attendance at XXXX. 

XXXX, as you likely know, has been widely discredited as a notorious and predatory for-profit school, and ultimately closed around XXXX, with a reputation for scandal and fraud. It was owned by XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ), a company with an equally atrocious reputation for defrauding students across its national chain of for-profit institutions. On XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted a complaint to the CFPB regarding Navients unfair collection of my XXXX XXXX XXXX debt stemming from my time at XXXX. 

The Department of Education has delivered student loan relief to borrowers who attended XXXX , as part of its settlement in the Sweet v. Cardona matter. In that settlement, the Department found that student borrowers who attended XXXX were entitled to presumptive relief because of a strong indicia of substantial misconduct by the school. However, I was denied similar relief because as Ive mentioned I hold no federal student loan debt associated with my enrollment at XXXX, just XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 

The Holder Rule preserves my right to challenge the legitimacy of my loans to Navient on account of my XXXX original wrongdoing. On XX/XX/XXXX, I asserted my right to a defense to repayment of these XXXX XXXX XXXX to Navient by submitting a XXXX misconduct application ( see attached ) along with a detailed explanation and several exhibits supporting my well-established position that XXXX XXXX engaged in misconduct that should negate XXXX XXXX XXXX ( also attached ). On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a denial notice ( see attached ) from Navient that provided no reason for my denial, stating only that I do not meet the requirements for discharge based on misconduct by your school. 

This is obviously an unfair and unreasonable result. I should at least be entitled to a reason for my denial. I have contacted Navient requesting an explanation for this decision, but I have not heard back yet. 

I suspect that I am being denied because Navient determined I cant produce a discharge notice from the Department of Education, which I obviously can not do because I never held any federal student loans from XXXX. However, if I did have federal student loans from XXXX, they would indeed have already been canceled through the Sweet settlement. Again, this is an unreasonable result that I hope the CFPB can help address. 

I was wronged by XXXX substantial misconduct. Consequently, I deserve my loans from XXXX to be canceled and I think it is unfair that Navient is denying me a fair process to present my well-founded case for loan cancellation.

On XX/XX/2024 I received notification from Navient my school misconduct application was denied. I provided detailed information to Navient regarding how my school engaged in financial aid fraud, used deceitful recruit tactics, forced admission decision via giving a mandatory short reply window, and engaging in repeated episodes of lying regarding accreditation plans.

2. Bank Verification : I have confirmed with my bank that there are no blocks or issues on their end that would prevent payments from being processed.

A dozen advocacy groups, including the XXXX and the Debt Collective, on Wednesday wrote to U.S. Secretary of Education XXXX XXXX, calling on the Biden Administration to cancel the student loan debt of borrowers who attended the for-profit XXXX XXXX , which from XXXX until just before its XXXX closure was owned by for-profit giant XXXX  XXXX XXXX, now called XXXX. 

XXXX offered programs in photography, filmmaking, and photo-journalism. Like other schools owned by XXXX, XXXX  used deceptive advertising and high-pressure recruiting to enroll students in over-priced programs that left many buried in debt, without the career advancement they sought. 

The letter, also signed by more than 250 former XXXX students, cites the findings of a report released this week that documents abuses at XXXX during the period that XXXX owned the school. The report was skillfully prepared by XXXX XXXX, a Debt Collective organizer and former XXXX student. 

The letter asserts that the Department already knows about a robust record of misconduct by XXXX, and the new report offers details on XXXX violations, based on hundreds of pages of records from congressional testimony, civil lawsuits, law enforcement probes, and media accounts. 

The report documents that XXXX misrepresented the costs of attending, facts about transferability of credits, and graduation and job placement rates, and enrolled students without regard to whether a program would help them succeed. 

According to the report, XXXX, which started as a family-run XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, enrolled about XXXX students under XXXX ownership. 

In a statement, XXXX said, XXXX XXXX borrowers have suffered long enough under the weight of deceptive practices. Its time for the Department to act decisively and provide the relief these borrowers deserve. 

XXXX XXXX, whose son earned a XXXX XXXX at XXXX from XXXX to XXXX, said the degree turned out to be pretty much worthless. XXXX added, The career counseling and promised leads never happened. The accreditation they claimed would lead to great jobs turned out to be nonexistent. The loans we were told would be easily paid off by our sons guaranteed high income are still lingering and growing like a XXXX due to the predatory and deceiving pressure put on us by XXXX XXXX and XXXX. XXXX said the loan debt had grown from about {$100000.00} to over {$330000.00}. XXXX, who is XXXX, said she and her husband will die with these loans still hanging over our heads. 

The Department under President XXXX  has offered automatic debt cancellation without the need for students to individually show, under the federal Borrower Defense process, that they were harmed to groups of students attending in specified years a number of predatory colleges, including the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 

Other students who have individually applied under Borrower Defense have become eligible for debt relief, including under the settlement of the Sweet v. Cardona lawsuit. But many borrowers, including former XXXX students, remain unaware of the magnitude of the XXXX scam or of their eligibility for loan relief. 

XXXX report notes that XXXX borrowers have made various efforts to cancel their debts, including through individual and class-action lawsuits against XXXX, XXXX, and lender XXXX XXXX , through the Borrowers Defense process, and other means, but none has meaningfully addressed the debt. 

Other groups signing the letter to Cardona include the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. 

As Republic Report has chronicled for over a decade, XXXX has been one of the worst actors in all of for-profit higher education, taking in billions of dollars from taxpayers for student grants and loans while repeatedly engaging in predatory abuses. 

XXXX has faced multiple law enforcement actions for predatory conduct. In XXXX, the company entered into a {$490.00} XXXX settlement with 48 state attorneys general, plus the District of Columbia, over allegations that it engaged in widespread deceptive practices against students. Later that same year, XXXX agreed to pay {$30.00} XXXX to settle charges brought by the Federal Trade Commission that its schools have recruited students through deceptive third-party lead generation operations. In each case, the company did not admit guilt. 

Recent XXXX employees have told media outlets XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, as well as Republic Report, that company recruiters have continued to feel pressure to make misleading sales pitches and to enroll low-income people into programs that arent strong enough to help them succeed. Some of those former employees also have spoken with federal investigators. 

XXXX XXXX reported in XXXX that the U.S. Department of Education, in XX/XX/XXXX, requested information from XXXX ; the Department also asked XXXX to retain records regarding student recruiting, marketing, financial aid practices, and more. XXXX confirmed the probe, while seeming to minimize its significance, in a XX/XX/XXXX SEC filing. XXXX also acknowledged in XX/XX/XXXX that it received a request for documents and information from the U.S. Justice Department.

I then continued to pay the agreed amounts each month, some months paying double because of not remembering the autopay would come out. 

Despite the fact that Navient said that these payments would be applied to both loans ( one larger loan and one smaller loan ) these payments were only applied to the smaller loan, and the larger loan went into default, which I did not know, because I knew I was making my payments on time and there was no update to the website to reflect that these autopayments were coming out. I called about this at least once and they said they didn't need to be reflected on the website because I had made the agreement over the phone. 

I continued to make these payments, again sometimes double, and the larger loan said no payment due for months... I still made the autopayments, assuming that, as agreed "" to make payments current '' as part of a "" forbearance agreement ''. Again, these payments were not applied to both loans ( even though I have the texts claiming that they would be ) from XX/XX/XXXX. 

On Friday, XX/XX/XXXX, at XXXX, I received a very suspicious-looking email claiming that "" time was running out '' but that I needed to call by XXXX Eastern time XX/XX/XXXX. This email also ( presumably illegally ) had a list at the bottom of the email of all email addresses receiving this email ( including mine ), a very informal subject line, a number of grammatical errors, and was sent from an informal-looking, personal email address. 

When I called this number that Friday evening, "" XXXX XXXX '' whose number I was given to work with directly, claimed that my loan had been in default since XXXX and even if I had called in XXXX it was too late. She claimed I needed to settle the debt for {$7600.00} by the end of the month, saying I could write a check by the XXXX to clear by the XXXX but that if it didn't clear I'd be even more legal trouble. 

When I proposed a realistic number that I could come up with by this date, she said it would "" ruin her reputation '' and she would be "" laughed out of the office ''. She said she would put this on hold until Monday, but that there was nothing I could do except for settle the debt before the end of the month, and that even though I had been paying more than the agreed upon amount the entire time, it wasn't their fault or problem that they had only applied these payments to one loan.

As an agency dedicated to protecting consumers from financial exploitation and ensuring fair treatment in the financial marketplace, I trust that you will investigate this issue with the utmost urgency and diligence. 

The XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX has been engaging in deceptive practices that have directly impacted numerous students and their financial well-being. Specifically, the institute has been implicated in fraudulent activities related to student loans, including but not limited to : 1. Misrepresentation of Loan Terms : Many students have reported that the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX misled them about the terms and conditions of their student loans. This includes false promises regarding interest rates, repayment options, and eligibility for loan forgiveness programs. 
2. Falsification of XXXX and XXXX Records : There is evidence to suggest that the institute has falsified enrollment and attendance records to fraudulently obtain federal student aid on behalf of students who may not have been actively attending classes or who were enrolled in programs that did not meet federal eligibility criteria. 
XXXX. Failure to Provide Adequate Educational Services : Despite charging exorbitant tuition fees, the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX has failed to deliver quality educational services to its students, leaving many graduates with substantial debt and inadequate skills to secure gainful employment in their chosen fields.

4. Predatory Lending Practices : The institute has been accused of engaging in predatory lending practices, targeting vulnerable students with high-pressure sales tactics to encourage them to take out loans without fully understanding the financial implications. 

These fraudulent practices have had devastating consequences for students who trusted the XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX to provide them with a quality education and support their career aspirations. Many graduates are now burdened with crippling debt and struggling to repay loans for degrees that have not yielded the promised benefits. 

I urge the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to launch a thorough investigation into the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 's student loan practices and take decisive action to hold the institution accountable for its misconduct. Additionally, I request that measures be taken to provide relief and assistance to affected students, including loan forgiveness and restitution for damages incurred.

XXXX Office of the Attorney General of New Jersey, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX New Jersey Student Loan Borrowers to Receive More than {$60.00} XXXX in Relief from Settlement with Navient Corp. in States Lawsuit Alleging Deceptive, Misleading Tactics by the Student Loan Servicer, XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Notably, Navients misconduct was a key basis for the lawsuit, with the attorneys general unfair and deceptive student loan servicing practices and abuses in originating predatory student loans.29 But the settlement only included borrowers who were in default for at least seven consecutive months before XX/XX/XXXX, meaning that Navient provided relief to only XXXX of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX of borrowers who had obtained predatory loans.30 Navient Has Denied Relief to XXXX XXXX XXXX  of Borrowers Although there are XXXX XXXX XXXX of loans clearly eligible for cancellation under the FTC Holder Rule and because of the misconduct of Navients predecessor, Navient makes it intimidating and difficult for borrowers to solicit relief.31 While ED established a process for group discharge for borrowers to automatically get relief on predatory federal loans without having to individually apply, Navient opened a school misconduct discharge application that is inordinately lengthy and complex for borrowers.32 The 12-page application, asks questions seemingly designed to knock out applications, such as when the wrongdoing was discovered, and requires borrowers to include individualized documentation such as correspondence from the school, marketing materials, advertisements, course catalogs, manuals, school web messaging, and other products all from loans that may be more than two decades old.33 The application threatens borrowers with perjury for providing incomplete information.34 It asks borrowers if the court has awarded a favorable judgment against their school, and if so, to attach the court order and other relevant documents to the application.35 It requires a narrative explanation of how [ the borrowers ] life has been impacted by the fraudulent loans and an explanation of why the misleading information that the school concealed or omitted from the borrower was important to them at the time of their application.36 These conditions are unnecessary and impractical and will prevent XXXX  of borrowers from obtaining the relief they deserve. Navient should stop making borrowers apply for relief and instead automatically cancel student debt using information the company already has about whether borrowers attended schools that would entitle them to relief. Navient should start by cancelling debt for students making payments on predatory loans that were not provided relief by the XXXX settlement.

Notably, The XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and their parent company, XXXX XXXX XXXX, were subject to investigations by various state attorneys general and found to have engaged in deceptive practices. In response to widespread allegations of fraud and misconduct by The XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, the XXXX XXXX announced a comprehensive loan discharge for students enrolled at these institutions from XX/XX/XXXX, to XX/XX/XXXX. I, however, did not have any of my loans XXXX. 

Navient, which was sued by the attorneys general of XXXX states for its role in facilitating these predatory loans, had a specific arrangement with for-profit schools during the early XXXX, making it a "" preferred '' lender.

Moreover, Navient exited the federal student loan servicing business amidst legislative and advocacy scrutiny, following allegations of steering borrowers away from income-driven repayment plans towards forbearance, an action for which they had to provide restitution.

Please be advised that under Section 611 ( 5 ) ( A ) of the FCRA you are required to ... promptly DELETE all information which can not be verified.

Its very obvious that your agency doesnt know what the FCRA is because, from the looks of my credit report and all the errors I see, you are disregarding it. So heres my breakdown.

1. The Fair Credit Reporting Act is the primary federal law governing the collection and reporting of credit information about consumers. Its rules cover how a consumer 's credit information is obtained, how long it is kept, and how it is shared with others, including consumers themselves.

2. What is an FCRA violation?

Creditors give reporting agencies inaccurate financial information about you. Reporting agencies mix up one person 's information with another 's because of a similar ( or the same ) last name or social security number. Agencies fail to follow guidelines for handling disputes.

3. My rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act Verify the accuracy of my report when it is required for employment purposes.

Receive notification if information in my file has been used against me in applying for credit or other transactions.

Disputeand have the bureaus correct and deleteinformation in my report that is incomplete, inaccurate, and unverifiable.

Remove outdated, negative information ( after seven years in most cases, 10 in the case of bankruptcy ).

I demand these items be deleted immediately. I entered the items and the outcome I desire below because you are in violation, and these items are not 100 % accurate, and they are either INACCURATE, Unverifiable, or Invalidated. I recently applied for extended credit and was denied. I am in distress because of your mistakes.

The law is very clear regarding the Civil liability and the remedy available to me ( Section 616 & 617 ) if you fail to comply with Federal Law. I am a litigious consumer and fully intend to pursue litigation in this matter to enforce my rights under the FCRA.

Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) Accuracy of Information ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ) : This section requires that consumer reporting agencies follow reasonable procedures to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual to whom the report relates.

Dispute Resolution ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ) : This section outlines the procedures that must be followed when a consumer disputes the accuracy of information in their credit report. It mandates that consumer reporting agencies must investigate disputes, usually within 30 days, and either verify, correct or delete the disputed information.

Furnisher Responsibilities ( 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ) : This section details the responsibilities of entities that furnish information to consumer reporting agencies. It requires furnishers to provide accurate information, investigate disputes received from consumer reporting agencies, and correct or delete inaccurate or unverified information. You list aliases ; who provided this information to you? You listed previous addresses. Who provided this information to you?

Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) Acquisition of Location Information ( 15 U.S.C. 1692b ) : While not directly about information accuracy, this section requires any debt collector communicating with any person other than the consumer to acquire location information about the consumer without stating that the consumer owes any debt.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION : Various laws have been enacted to protect the privacy of individuals ' SSNs, restricting their use and disclosure. Here are five relevant laws and five case citations that reflect the legal landscape around the protection of Social Security numbers.

Laws Protecting Social Security Numbers The Privacy Act of 1974 ( 5 U.S.C. 552a ) restricts how the federal government can disclose personal information, such as Social Security numbers. It mandates that government agencies must have a relevant and necessary reason to collect an individuals SSN and must also inform individuals how their SSN will be used.

Social Security Number Protection Act of 2010 : This Act prohibits explicitly printing an individuals Social Security number on checks issued for payment by the federal government, as well as on any card required for accessing government services, to reduce the risk of SSN theft.

Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) ( 20 U.S.C. 1232g ) : FERPA protects the privacy of student education records. It applies to all schools that receive funds under an applicable program of the U.S. Department of Education. Schools must have written permission from the parent or eligible student to release any information from a student 's education record, which includes the Social Security number, except under certain legally specified circumstances.

Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act ( FACTA ) of 2003 : This act amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act to enhance the accuracy of reports and includes provisions to help reduce identity theft, such as the truncation of credit cards and Social Security numbers on printed receipts.

Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act of 1998 ( 18 U.S.C. 1028 ) : While not solely focused on SSNs, this Act makes it a federal crime to knowingly use another person 's identification with fraudulent intent, which includes the unauthorized use of someones Social Security number. 

Case Citations Regarding Social Security Number Privacy In re XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX. XXXX ) : Although not exclusively about SSNs, this case dealt with the broader issue of personal information security, including SSNs, in the context of a data breach. 

XXXX XXXX  XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) : This case addressed damages related to the unauthorized disclosure of an individual 's Social Security number by the government, underscoring the privacy interests associated with SSNs. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX Cir. XXXX ) : This case involved the issue of an employer 's responsibility to protect employees ' Social Security numbers and the legal ramifications of failing to do so. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX Cir. XXXX ) : The court discussed the privacy implications of collecting and potentially disclosing students Social Security numbers without proper safeguards. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) : This New Hampshire Supreme Court case emphasized the duty of information brokers to exercise care in disclosing personal information such as Social Security numbers to third parties, highlighting the potential for harm from such disclosures. 
These laws and cases highlight the legal protections afforded to Social Security numbers and the serious considerations given to their privacy and security in various contexts, including federal records, educational settings, and identity theft prevention. 

Communication in Connection with Debt Collection ( 15 U.S.C. 1692c ) : This section prohibits deceptive collection practices, indirectly requiring that any information communicated not be misleading or inaccurate.

Validation of Debts ( 15 U.S.C. 1692g ) : This pivotal section requires debt collectors to provide consumers with a written notice containing the amount of the debt, the name of the creditor, and a statement that unless the consumer disputes the validity of the debt within 30 days, the debt will be assumed to be valid by the debt collector.

Consumer Credit Protection Act ( CCPA ) The CCPA is a broader act that encompasses several statutes, including the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ), the FCRA, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act ( ECOA ), and the FDCPA. The acts mentioned above directly address specific requirements for verified, validated, and accurate information reporting. However, the CCPA 's establishment of these acts under its umbrella signifies the legislative framework for consumer credit protection, including accurate and fair credit reporting and debt collection practices.

Consequences for Non-Compliance Failure to comply with these requirements can result in several consequences for creditors, debt collectors, and consumer reporting agencies, including : Civil Liability ( e.g., 15 U.S.C. 1681n, 1681o for FCRA ) : As a consumer, I can bring a civil action against violators for actual damages, statutory damages, and punitive damages in cases of willful non-compliance. I prefer to bring the claim against their insurance bonds.

Enforcement Actions : Agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), along with the Small Claims Court having jurisdiction, can enforce these laws, potentially resulting in fines, penalties, and injunction/directives to correct practices.

Reputational Damage : Non-compliance can also lead to reputational damage, i.e., libel and slander elements of defamation of character and civil action affecting the violating entity 's business relationships and consumer trust.

Therefore, I formally challenge the accuracy and validity of any information on my credit report that does not meet these standards. I request that you promptly investigate and remove any such information from my credit report. Failure to do so will result in further action, including pursuing legal remedies available to me under the law. This presentment contains specific reference to the disputed information in question format and otherwise!

Please send me written confirmation once the investigation is complete and any inaccuracies have been corrected. If you require any additional information or clarification regarding this matter, you may contact me at the address provided above.

* Please remove all non-account holding inquiries Please note that you have 30 days to complete this investigation, as per the Fair Credit Reporting Act Section 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ).

These loans are an undue burden and act as a unfair punishment, as I continue to uphold my end of the agreement by making my payments faihtfully, but those on the other end, have not, by taking the degree obtained by the loans for those payments and making it worthless and no longer useful for improving my life circumstances and finances.

When I attended the school, I was pressured to take out so many loans every semester and for amounts ranging {$6000.00} to {$25000.00} a SEMESTER! I have over {$100000.00} in student loans and no idea where that money went, because now the AI is CLOSED and all my "" credits '' aren't transferring for me to get my masters. Because of my loans all defaulting due to NAVIENT NOT WORKING WITH ME ever, I know can't get an aid to go to school to get a REAL degree. Every time you call about your loans, they make me hold for hours and then tell me I have two options and NEITHER are do able. {$3000.00} a month for a loan payment is unmanageable. And the longer I'm not paying on these the HIGHER this interest goes. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX due to the stress of this situation, I can't get a home to live in - no mortgage, NO CAR, I can't get anything. These loans are ruining my life. All because I was pressured at a young age to get ridiculous amounts of loans some of which I didn't even need all that. 
Because of the numerous claims of fraud and misconduct perpetrated by these online for profit schools, such as XXXX, I was able to file a Borrower Defense claim with the Dept. of Education against XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX, and my Fed. loans of ( {$22000.00} ) were discharged and my credit repaired.

My Borrower Defense Claim was also part of the Sweet Vs. Cardona settlement for which I was a full class member.

I am aware that Navient was sued by 39 state AGs regarding their predatory loans to attend these online for-profit schools and that Sallie Mae/Navient were a "" preferred '' lending company in a "" deal '' with these schools during the early 2000 's. These private loans with a high risk of default were part of a package deal offered to "" for profit online schools ''. But loans made to students in states outside of the agreement, or those who were not in default for 7 months or more during a "" specific '' time frame, were excluded. I am sure this was a big win for Navient, but what a sham of a settlement deal for the rest of borrowers scammed into taking loans to at least 150 for profit online schools. After the AG settlement, didn't Navient also get out of the Federal student loan business due to scrutiny from lawmakers and borrower advocates? Didn't Navient have to pay restitution to the Federal student loan borrowers for not informing students of IDR/IBR payments students could have enrolled in, but instead steered toward forbearance? Furthermore, hasn't Navient been sued at least a half dozen times for other predatory loan practices and illegal collection practices? 
I am also aware of a "" pilot '' program by which Navient is sending out "" applications '' to select students who may have filed Borrower Defense claims against their schools and were approved.

03/22/24,Student loan,Private student loan,Getting a loan,Confusing or misleading advertising,"I attended XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX in XXXX from XXXX. They changed their name to XXXX XXXX shortly after. I have a private loan that has an accrued an interest of {$7300.00} when the loan was for {$4000.00}. My mother also took out private loans for my schooling currently totaling {$14000.00}. 

Navient originated predatory subprime private loans to students attending for-profit schools and colleges with low graduation rates even though it knew that a very HIGH percentage of such borrowers would be unable to repay the loans. Navient made these risky subprime loans as "" an inducement to get schools to use Navient as a preferred lender '' for highly profitable federal and private loans without regard for borrowers and their families, many of whom were young, like myself, and ensnared in debts they could never repay. 

Navient had a multi-state settlement a few years back where they gave private loan debt relief to borrowers who had XXXX consecutive months of delinquent payments prior to XX/XX/2021. What a SLAP in the face for the people who literally struggle month to month to pay these XXXX loans!!! I can't get approved for a home. I can't get a car loan unless I pay outrageously high interest rates. If I'm even a couple days late, Navient is already calling and emailing every chance they get. I'm afraid of Navient calling my job or garnishing my wages which is why I try to be on time with payment but as a single mother of XXXX who's on public aid, it gets very difficult. 

After this settlement, Navient got out of the federal loan business due to scrutiny from lawmakers and borrower advocates and Navient had to pay restitution to the federal student loan borrowers for not informing students if XXXX XXXX XXXX student could have enrolled in but instead steered towards forbearance. 
Navient has been sued at least half a dozen times for other predatory loan practices and illegal collection practices.",None,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",IL,60804,None,Consent provided,Web,03/22/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,8608292

06/24/24,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Keep getting calls about your loan,"Navient, in my opinion, has engaged in predatory collection practices that have constituted harassment. According to the Fair Debt Credit Collections Act, companies are not allowed to : "" ... place repetitious phone calls or use electronic communications such as text, email, and social media messages intended to harass, oppress, or abuse you or any person ... '' Navient called me repeatedly and incessantly, between XXXX, sometimes XXXX times DAILY, while I was at work ( see attachments - I have only included a few because the amount that I would have had to include was excessive and would have belabored the point ). This was a concern in a previous complaint I lodged against Navient. Additionally, due to the fact that I was at work, the repeated calls were in danger of jeopardizing my employment. I was also attempting to deal with the impending death of a parent who was on life support and silencing my phone to prevent interruptions from Navient and to prevent possible disciplinary action at work was not an option -- I needed to be able to be reached by the hospital. During a short break XXXX day, I did answer the phone abruptly and inquire as to the reason for their repeated calls. The gentleman that responded informed me that I had a past due amount and I responded that I was aware and that I would pay them when I was able, when I obtained the funds to pay them. He stated that that was all he needed to know and I asked him/the company to stop calling me. I have been enrolled in XXXX and thought there was a discrepancy in the XXXX XXXX amount ( {$160.00} ) and the regular payment ( {$190.00} ), a difference of {$28.00}. My XXXX was active when the last XXXX payment was deducted on XX/XX/year>. My understanding is that XXXX is active unless it is stopped by the consumer. But, whatever my payment arrangements are with a company, I am responsible, aware, and do not need to be 'pushed ' to uphold my responsibilities : when I state that I am aware of my debt and that I will address it when I am able, that is what I will do. If late penalties are assessed, that is for me to address ; the harassment is unwarranted. 

Anyway, the incessant calls continued : as soon as I arrived at work, during the work day, at the hospital during visits and discussions with specialists, surgeons, out-of-town family members, even during the family hour ( my father eventually did pass away ), the funeral, the repast, during the grieving period that followed, I had to deal with XXXX calls a day from Navient, XXXX of the calls coming in the late evening both after XXXX XXXX  ( I am aware that they can call up until XXXX XXXX but the point I make is that they called me all day and I had no respite from them : the calls began shortly after XXXX XXXX and continued into the evening ). Initially, when they called, they were hanging up without leaving a message, which also is not supposed to happen : "" ... debt collectors are to provide certain information when they first communicate with you, or shortly after, which is often in a letter called a validation notice ... '' They at no time left a voicemail about their reason for calling and would terminate the call and then, call right back. I began to block their calls since I had already spoken with someone about awareness of my debt and had asked them to discontinue calling. I sincerely felt harassed, felt an incredible amount of stress and anxiety, began to be afflicted with XXXX XXXX XXXX and wanted to just be left alone to deal with the death of my parent. 

Last weekend, I sat down to review my account with Navient and saw that they had not been withdrawing the basic autopay amount nor the new payment amount -- they had sent emails alerting me that the payment was going to change and because I enrolled in XXXX, I assumed the payments would continue but the new amount would be deducted. Out of stress and wanting the XXXX to end, I scheduled a payment but backed out of it when I realized I would be overextending myself. The calls stopped for XXXX day and then began again in earnest, XXXX times a day, as usual. Absolutely appalling. Now that my life has quieted, I was able to address my finances and paid the past due amount of {$390.00}. I'm assuming that I will need to re-enroll in XXXX once this payment has cleared BUT I am asking that Navient 's methods of addressing delinquencies/contacting customers be addressed. Their methods are unnecessary, harassing, and predatory and I do not care what a customer owes, that treatment should not be imposed upon anyone.

The original loans were disbursed on : XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$13000.00} and XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$10000.00}.

Furthermore, hasn't Navient been sued at least a half dozen times for other predatory loan practices and illegal collection practices? 

I am also aware of a "" pilot '' program by which Navient is sending out "" applications '' to select students who may have filed Borrower Defense claims against their schools and were approved.

As a matter of fact, XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX and their Parent company, XXXX were investigated by the attorneys general of several states and have been found to have acted in a fraudulent manner. 

Because of the numerous claims of fraud and misconduct perpetrated by XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, the Biden administration has just announced a blanket discharge for anyone enrolled at XXXX XXXX XXXX from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. 

My Federal loans in the amount of {$84000.00} were discharged and my credit repaired. 
I am aware that Navient was sued by 39 state AGs regarding their predatory loans to attend these online for-profit schools and that Sallie Mae/Navient were a "" preferred '' lending company in a "" deal '' with these schools during the early XXXX 's. 

These private loans with a high risk of default were part of a package deal offered to "" for profit online schools '', but loans made to students in states outside of the agreement, or those who were not in default for 7 months or more during a "" specific '' time frame, were excluded. 

I am sure this was a big win for Navient, but what a sham of a settlement deal for the rest of borrowers scammed into taking loans to at least 150 for profit online schools. 
After the AG settlement, didn't Navient also get out of the Federal student loan business due to scrutiny from lawmakers and borrower advocates? 

Didn't Navient have to pay restitution to the Federal student loan borrowers for not informing students of IDR/IBR payments students could have enrolled in, but instead steered toward forbearance? 

Furthermore, hasn't Navient been sued at least a half dozen times for other predatory loan practices and illegal collection practices? 

I am also aware of a "" pilot '' program by which Navient is sending out "" applications '' to select students who may have filed Borrower Defense claims against their schools and were approved.This application is a sham. Why do we need to prove anything? Navient knows who we are. 

Under the FTC "" Holder Rule '' Navient is liable for giving predatory loans in connection with online for-profit schools. 

Time is running out for Navient to do right by students who were scammed into taking out private loans to attend online for profit colleges who have committed misconduct and misrepresented themselves to the public to entice students to enroll. 

Senator XXXX XXXX has sent a letter to Navient 's CEO asking to discharge these loans NOW! It's time Navient does the right thing and discharge all these predatory private loans made to attend online for profit schools NOW!

At one point in XXXX or XXXX, Sallie Mae raised my interest rate to 14 % for the next trimester, telling me over the phone, Well, you can drop out, but you still owe us what youve taken out so far.

After almost 2 years of continuous FSA complaints, emails, calls and chats, the ombudsman verified that I would not qualify for a refund because the payments I made during that time went to the commercial navient student loan trust.

From my understanding, if those loans went into default, the government would take responsibility and ownership, and any payments made after that are refunded under borrower defense. 

I can assume that this situation has come up for many, and has been discussed here. 
However, I havent been able to find any action being taken on our part from any government entity, or lawsuit Is there anything we can do to make this situation fair for all of us.

Navient responded to my application for discharge with a generic one page letter that said Navient carefully considers a variety of factors in determining whether a private loan should be discharged based on school misconduct and you do not meet the requirements for discharge based on misconduct at your school. 

Their statement is not specific. I want to know explicitly why my application was denied and when I spoke to a Navient representative they could not tell me.

As per the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 USC 1681 section 602a ), it is emphasized that consumer reporting agencies must conduct their duties with fairness, impartiality, and a regard for the privacy rights of consumers. XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX operate as consumer reporting agencies, while I, as the consumer, retain the right to safeguard my private information, as stipulated by 15 USC 6801. This regulation underscores the Congressional policy, mandating that each financial institution bears a continuous responsibility to honor the privacy of its customers and uphold the security and confidentiality of their nonpublic personal information. 
XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and NAVIENT, as defined under that title, qualify as a financial institutions. According to 15 USC 1681 section 604a, subsection 2, it is stipulated that "" In general, Subject to subsection ( c ), any consumer reporting agency may furnish a consumer report under the following circumstances and no other : in accordance with the written instructions of the consumer to whom it relates. '' Neither the banks, XXXX XXXX, Sallie Mae, and NAVIENT, nor the consumer reporting agencies, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX, have obtained my consent to furnish this information, particularly lacking my written consent. Any form of consent, be it verbal, non-verbal, written, implied, or otherwise, given to XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX XXXX, Sallie Mae, and NAVIENT is hereby revoked. 
Moreover, 15 USC 6802 ( b ) ( c ) specifies that "" A financial institution may not disclose nonpublic personal information to a nonaffiliated third party unlessthe consumer is given an explanation of how the consumer can exercise that nondisclosure option. '' XXXX XXXX, Sallie Mae, and NAVIENT failed to inform me of my right to exercise my nondisclosure option.

'' This account constitutes an adverse item being reported again without my permission, which is a violation of the law.

Moreover, according to 15 U.S. Code 1681s2 ( A ) ( 1 ) A, it is prohibited for a person to furnish any information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate. Additionally, 15 U.S. Code 1681e mandates that every consumer reporting agency must maintain reasonable procedures to avoid violations of section 1681c and limit the furnishing of consumer reports to the purposes listed under section 1681b. XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX are evidently not upholding reasonable procedures in this regard. 
As the CFPB has the responsibility to protect consumer rights, additional grievances are as follows : 1. The Privacy Act of 1974 ( 5 U.S. Code 552a ) defines record as any item, collection, or grouping of information about an individual that is maintained by an agency, including, but not limited to, his education, financial transactions, medical history, and criminal or employment history and that contains his name, or the identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular assigned to the individual, such as a finger or voice print or a photograph. It defines Conditions of Disclosure as no agency shall disclose any record which is contained in a system of records by any means of communication to any person, or to another agency, except pursuant to a written request by, or with the prior written consent of, the individual to whom the record pertains, unless disclosure of the record would be to a consumer reporting agency in accordance with section 3711 ( e ) of title 31. Additionally, Part 1016- Privacy of Consumer Financial Information ( Regulation P ), 12 CFR 1016.7 Form of opt out notice to consumers ; opt out methods, section ( a ) states, under ( 1 ) form of opt out notice, that if company is required to provide an opt out notice under 1016.10 ( a ), they must provide a clear and conspicuous notice to each of their consumers that accurately explains the right to opt out under that section. The notice must state : ( i ) That company discloses or reserve the right to disclose nonpublic personal information about consumer to a nonaffiliated third party ; ( ii ) That the consumer has the right to opt out of that disclosure; and ( iii ) A reasonable means by which the consumer may exercise the opt out right.

My rights are protected under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ), a federal law enacted in 1974.

Despite having paid {$84000.00} towards this loans, my current balance stands at {$13000.00} due to an exorbitant interest rate, which currently is 16 %. 

Notably, XXXX XXXX XXXX  was subject to investigations by various state attorneys general and found to have engaged in deceptive practices. In response to widespread allegations of fraud and misconduct by XXXX XXXXXXXX and their predatory lending practices with Sallie Mae. One of my loans was part of this lawsuit, while the other was not due to having a co-signer, which Navient just released and removed from the loan. The AG lawsuit led to one of my loans, from XXXX XXXXXXXX and for the same Associates degree as the remains loan left, with over {$80000.00} discharged.

Navient, which was sued by the attorneys general of 39 states for its role in facilitating these predatory loans, had a specific arrangement with for-profit schools during the XXXX XXXX, making it a "" preferred '' lender. Despite this, the settlement terms provided by Navient were considerably inadequate, excluding many borrowers who took loans for attendance at approximately 150 for-profit online schools, unless they resided in certain states or had not defaulted for at least seven months during a specified period. This loan was in forbearance for many months following the years of graduating. 

The only period during which I managed to reduce the principal amount was during the pandemic, when interest rates were temporarily lowered to between 0.5 % and 1 %. However, once the regular interest rates resumed, my balance skyrocketed again. This financial strain, coupled with the emotional stress and damage to personal relationships, has been overwhelming. 

Moreover, Navient exited the federal student loan servicing business amidst legislative and advocacy scrutiny, following allegations of steering borrowers away from income-driven repayment plans towards forbearance, an action for which they had to provide restitution. 

Navient has also faced multiple lawsuits for other predatory lending and illegal collection practices. Currently, Navient is distributing "" applications '' to select students who may qualify for Borrower Defense claims against their schools. However, this process feels unnecessary and opaque, as Navient is already aware of the affected students.

I have 8 Private Loans with them all with co-signers. I am also part of the XXXX settlement, post-class. Below are my on-going and continuous problems with Navient : Problem 1 : I am paid every other week, so Navient splits my monthly payment in 2 and withdraws from my checking account half the full amount each time I get paid. For months I get paid three times that month, I always tell them not to withdraw my checking account for the 3rd pay period. Sometimes they withdraw from my checking account that 3rd pay period and sometimes they do not. Either way they do it, I get bumped out of my payment programs and have to spend an additional 1+ hour to get this resolved. The last time this happened was XX/XX/XXXX and it took me 2 months to get this resolved. They did reimburse me the extra payment I made only to set up additional monthly withdrawals of {$1700.00} every month on top of the {$1600.00} I already pay them monthly. I had to call a 3rd time to get the {$1700.00} reimbursed and that additional monthly withdrawal removed from my Navient account. Every year I deal with this multiple times and am told completely different reasons as to why this happens with no accountability on their part and them telling me I did something wrong. 
Problem 2 : Misinformation amongst Navient employees is rampant! I ask them to record EVERY time I call so there is a trail of what was said. I know they do not listen to the recordings, but theres nothing I can do about that. I have been told many times two different things by two different people and both were wrong which usually only hurts me. I am also told that I misunderstood what was told even though I write everything down. I ask them to review the recording of the conversation and they tell me they do not need to and all they need to do is read the notes from the previous CSR which are also usually wrong or only have half the information. Every time I point that out, Im told there is nothing they can do. 
Problem XXXX : Ridiculous interest rates! I have paid over {$230000.00} since XXXX on loans that originally totaled {$220000.00}. I currently still owe {$240000.00}. I will never get these loans paid off and that is ridiculous. 
Problem XXXX : I have requested MANY times to have my cosigners released as I have met the criteria and they deny it every time with no explanation and when I call, no one seems to know why even managers. 
Problem XXXX : Their late fees are out of control. I have my payments automatically withdrawn from my checking account where I have NO control over the amount taken out and yet, I am constantly being charged late fees. Most of the time that happens after Problem 1 occurs and when I bring it to their attention that it was not my fault, they still charge me noting, there is nothing I can do about that. If youre late, we have to charge you, totally disregarding the error was not on me. Again, XXXX accountability on their part with all the blame on me for something I have no control over.

Many of us have even more debt in private loans than federal loans, and we are still expected to pay it despite overwhelming evidence of fraud, mishandlings, losing payment records, deceit and other criminal activity involving our loans and payments. We need to take action while this issue is in the spotlight, to have these private loans discharged in addition to the federal student loans. Loan balances through companies such as Navient, XXXX, XXXX XXXX and loan companies used for consolidation purposes should all be cancelled and refunded if those loans are taken out for a university on the list of fraudulent schools from the XXXX v. XXXX case . '' Thousands of students were scammed by Navient into taking out predatory private loans to attend for profit online schools such as the one I attended, XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX  XXXX XXXX and their Parent company, XXXX were investigated by the attorneys general of several states and have been found to have acted in a fraudulent manner. 

Because of the numerous claims of fraud and misconduct perpetrated by XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX, the XXXX administration has just announced a blanket discharge for anyone enrolled at XXXX XXXX XXXX from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. 

My Federal loans from the XXXX XXXX got an email from the XXXX administration on XX/XX/XXXX that says it will be discharged and my credit repaired due to the governments investigation on these predatory, for profit schools-seen here at this link. I can also provide evidence of this email upon request. 
Link : XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX I am aware that Navient was sued by 39 state AGs regarding their predatory loans to attend these online for-profit schools and that Sallie Mae/Navient were a `` preferred '' lending company in a "" deal '' with these schools during the early XXXX 's. 

These private loans with a high risk of default were part of a package deal offered to "" for profit online schools '', but loans made to students in states outside of the agreement, or those who were not in default for 7 months or more during a "" specific '' time frame, were excluded. I fell into the grey category where I tried to pay but had defaulted so many times until about XXXX BUT it didn't count so I continued to pay. And now with the evidence that XXXX XXXX press release made this doesn't make sense why I can't be absolved of these loans if the federal government is pointing that these were completely misrepresented schools. 

I am sure this was a big win for Navient, but what a sham of a settlement deal for the rest of borrowers scammed into taking loans to at least 150 for profit online schools. 

After the AG settlement, didn't Navient also get out of the Federal student loan business due to scrutiny from lawmakers and borrower advocates? Didn't Navient have to pay restitution to the Federal student loan borrowers for not informing students of IDR/IBR payments students could have enrolled in, but instead steered toward forbearance? Furthermore, hasn't Navient been sued at least a half dozen times for other predatory loan practices and illegal collection practices? 

I am also aware of a "" pilot '' program by which Navient is sending out "" applications '' to select students who may have filed Borrower Defense claims against their schools and were approved. Why is this not offered to everyone right now? Even finding out about it was difficult and only because of the XXXX v XXXX this came to light as well for consumers. 

Under the FTC "" Holder Rule '' Navient is liable for giving predatory loans in connection with online for-profit schools. 

Time is running out for Navient to do right by students who were scammed into taking out private loans to attend online for profit colleges who have committed misconduct and misrepresented themselves to the public to entice students to enroll. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX has sent a letter to Navient 's CEO asking to discharge these loans NOW! It's time Navient do the right thing and discharge all these predatory private loans made to attend online for profit schools NOW! Because the Dept of Education has done the right thing for federal loans due to the overwhelming evidence, us consumers deserve the right to submit and get these removed as well especially those have tried to do the right thing and continue to pay but suffer greatly to our quality of life and "" education '' received.

I faxed the requested documents on XX/XX/XXXX. ( See attachment ) They also told me at that time that I would not owe anything, and they would place me in forbearance or deferment. I told them that instead, I would pay them XXXX a month until I knew an exact amount. I have done so and am still doing so XXXX. 

I checked in with Navient on XX/XX/XXXX to make sure that they had processed my application from XX/XX/XXXX. They claimed that they never received it. I faxed another application on XX/XX/XXXX.

By now I was into XXXX of XXXX, with no movement and confusing and conflicting directives from Navient.

I also have private student loans used to attend the same school during the same time period. Those were not being automatically discharged like the federal loans. Instead I found I needed to fill out a complicated application to ATTEMPT to get the private loans discharged. This was already ridiculous as there is no reason for the private loans to remain while the federal loans are discharged. They were used for the same fraudulent school so they should both be discharged.

Specifically, the "" Holder Rule '' applies and means that my private loans should be discharged due to the misconduct of the XXXX XXXX. 

But because Navient wants to make things difficult I still had to apply for and fill out an application. 

In a previous complaint I requested that Navient provide me with an application for Student Loan Discharge due to School Misconduct. Their response to that first complaint contained this excerpt : "" Thank you for reaching out to the CFPB with your concerns regarding your student loan account. Navient currently services your XXXX XXXX XXXX Student Loans that were disbursed for your attendance at the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Thank you for inquiring about a school misconduct discharge for your private loans. We are in the early stages of this new process and have determined that your loans meet the criteria for you to receive an application. '' So at this point they admit that my loans are eligible to receive the application. This suggests they believe that my loans are also potentially eligible to be discharged due to school misconduct. Otherwise I don't see why they would even send me the application. 

I spent XXXX weeks gathering evidence and completing the application. I submitted it to Navient and after a month they replied that my application was denied. There was no actual explanation as to why I was denied. 

I submitted another complaint, asking for a clear explanation of why I was denied when the act of denial makes no logical sense in my situation. And I have seen others who attended an XXXX XXXX submit an application and have it approved. There seems to be no rhyme or reason to who Navient chooses to approve or deny. And without clarity from them I can only assume it's essentially random. 

Navient responded to this latest complaint with essentially the same circular logic "" explanation '' for my denial. Again, there is XXXX clarity and Navient isn't doing what they are obligated to do. 

This was their latest response : "" Thank you for inquiring about a school misconduct discharge for your XXXX XXXX XXXX Student Loans.

Despite having paid hundreds of dollars towards these loans, my current balance stands at {$7400.00} due to an exorbitant interest rate, which currently is 12.5 %. 

Notably, XXXX  XXXX XXXX and their parent company, XXXX, were subject to investigations by various state attorneys general and found to have engaged in deceptive practices. In response to widespread allegations of fraud and misconduct by XXXX  XXXX XXXX, the XXXX administration recently announced a comprehensive loan discharge for students enrolled at these institutions from XX/XX/XXXX, to XX/XX/XXXX. This led to the discharge of my federal loans totaling XXXX  XXXX and the restoration of my credit. 

Navient, which was sued by the attorneys general of XXXX states for its role in facilitating these predatory loans, had a specific arrangement with for-profit schools during the early XXXX, making it a "" preferred '' lender. Despite this, the settlement terms provided by Navient were considerably inadequate, excluding many borrowers who took loans for attendance at approximately XXXX for-profit online schools, unless they resided in certain states or had not defaulted for at least seven months during a specified period. 

The only period during which I managed to reduce the principal amount was during the pandemic, when interest rates were temporarily lowered to between 0.5 % and 1 %. However, once the regular interest rates resumed, my balance skyrocketed again. This financial strain, coupled with the emotional stress and damage to personal relationships, has been overwhelming. 

Moreover, Navient exited the federal student loan servicing business amidst legislative and advocacy scrutiny, following allegations of steering borrowers away from income-driven repayment plans towards forbearance, an action for which they had to provide restitution. 

Navient has also faced multiple lawsuits for other predatory lending and illegal collection practices. Currently, Navient is distributing "" applications '' to select students who may qualify for Borrower Defense claims against their schools.

Some of my loans were taken out with XXXX XXXX and later moved to Navient. Both companies were also under scrutiny for fraudulent practices over the years in relation to this and many other schools. These lawsuits led to the XXXX v. XXXX settlement, where my federal loans were forgiven. However, there appeared to be no hope for my private loans with Navient over the fraudulent practices of the school I attended or Navient 's behavior over student loans. 

In XXXX, I refinanced my Navient loans with another loan company. I tried to avoid doing this to hold hope for relief elsewhere, but my interest rate was variable and had reached 10 % interest. I could no longer afford these payments and having paid my loans since XXXX, I was getting increasingly frustrated. After doing the math, I had already paid more than twice what I had borrowed by that time. Speaking with Navient support over the years to find relief, none was offered. I had exhausted my deferments and I didn't want to defer payments anymore anyway. Reducing payments or interest were not offered. I felt that I had no choice to move somewhere else. 

However, I am not seeing Navient offering some borrowers an application to forgive their loan balances in the form of a school misconduct discharge. I am increasingly more frustrated with this situation since I had paid so much to Navient, felt hopeless in my situation, and believed my only option for relief was with another servicer to pay a reduced rate. 

Considering the school I attended engaged in fraudulent activity against thousands of students, including myself, and Navient was also scrutinized in relation to this behavior, I would like to see Navient offer me the opportunity to apply for discharge, then buy my loans back to forgive them as the same opportunity as those that still have their loans with Navient.

I went to the school "" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  '', a branch of the "" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX '', in XXXX and Graduated with a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. This school has since closed down. 
When I took these loans out, I did so under the impression that it would be possible to pay them back, or at least pay them down. This was an impression that was instilled in me by the school 's financial department when I first visited the campus in XXXX VA. In addition to this, I was repeatedly told that I did not qualify for any other financial assistance, and that these loans were the last and only way. 


When I first began paying back the loans, I was given a monthly payment of $ XXXX to begin with, and was given six months as an initial grace period. The XXXX XXXX itself did next to nothing to assist me in finding work, instead just pointing me to a freelancing site. I struggled to find any employment in that six months, and soon needed more time. When I went to Navient ( Then Sallie Mae ), the forbearance they offered at the time costed {$150.00} each time and only lasted for ~three months each to the best of my knowledge. Due to the level of difficulty I had finding work, my forbearance was used up very early on, and I can no longer rely on them as an option. 


When I eventually was making income, I struggled immensely to make payments each month, as the Navient payments were not the only loans that had been taken out when I was going to XXXX. For many months most of my income was dedicated to student loans and little else. There were times when I was able to get on to an Interest Rate Reduction program with the Navient loans, but those were temporary and my loan amount would quickly balloon again since the interest rates were 13-16 %. As of this day, my normal payment is set to {$2000.00}, and even going on a payment plan will only decrease it to $ XXXX. Despite the difficulty, I managed to keep paying my loans without defaulting, which unfortunately made me intelligible for the Attorney General settlement debt cancellation in XXXX.

Given the circumstances surrounding the closure of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX and its involvement in fraudulent practices, I urgently require the Navient School Misconduct Discharge application to proceed with the resolution of my student loan debt.

I kindly request your assistance with receiving the Navient School Misconduct Discharge application.

08/30/24,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"My name is XXXX XXXX. Sadly, I have learned that I am a victim of an elaborate and systematic NAVIENT scam to direct unsuspecting NAVIENT student loan borrowers to third party brokers to steer said student loan borrows into student loan forgiveness for a substantial upfront fee unbeknown to the student loan borrower. In this nefarious scheme, in my case, when a student loan borrower contacts NAVIENT 's customer service, the student loan borrower without their knowledge is automatically redirected to a third party broker under the guise that this third party broker is a representative of NAVIENT. 

Once connected to this third party broker, this individual does not identify himself/herself as a third party broker nor their intentions, but misrepresents themselves as NAVIENT representatives as they execute their scheme to convince student loan borrowers to allow the third party broker to file for student loan forgiveness as this is the only repayment option available to the student loan borrower. As part of this fraudulent process, the student loan borrower is misled to believe that s/he must pay a substantial amount towards their loan in order for the forgiveness process to move forward. However, this is a blatant lie. These funds are actually the third party broker 's fee which this individual has deliberately concealed from the student loan borrower. In short, the student loan borrower is misled to believe that ( 1 ) pursuing student loan forgiveness is their only option to repay their student loan ( 2 ) a payment is required in advance to apply for student loan forgiveness and ( 3 ) that this payment is put towards their student loan when in fact it is a fee to enrich the pocket of the third party broker. 

That said, on XX/XX/year>, I contacted NAVIENT customer service to adjust my long-standing IDR repayment plan as, unfortunately, I was made redundant by my employer on XX/XX/year> and would not be able to make the current payments as I did not have any income. Before contacting NAVIENT, I resubmitted my IDR repayment plan through the Student Aid Gov website, however, as time was of the essence and making sure that a did not default on my student loan, I thought it best to also contact NAVIENT to make sure that they are aware of my unemployment status and confirm that my IDR repayment plan was adjusted accordingly to reflect XXXX income. 

I was connected to whom I believed to be a NAVIENT representative, and explained my change of income circumstances. This individual proceeded to tell me that I needed to pay USD XXXX in order to change my IDR repayment plan so that my payments would go to XXXX. I responded by saying that in the over 25 years of this outstanding student loan that I have never been required to pay a fee to amend my IDR repayment plan. He responded by saying that then there was no guarantee that my IDR repayment would be adjusted to my current income of XXXX. I then requested to speak to a supervisor, and after waiting for almost an hour to no avail, I discontinued the call. 

Thinking that perhaps this NAVIENT representative was mistaken, I immediately called NAVIENT customer service again to speak to a different representative. I was connected to XXXX XXXX, whom I believed was a NAVIENT representative. At no time, during our conversation, did XXXX XXXX identify himself as a third party broker, or state that NAVIENT redirected my call to a third party broker. Again, I informed XXXX XXXX of my unemployment status and that I wanted to adjust my current IDR repayment plan as I would not be able to make the payments. I, also, told XXXX XXXX about my encounter with the previous representative who asked for an upfront payment to adjust my IDR repayment plan. As XXXX XXXX had access to all of my NAVIENT account information, and spoke with authority about my student loan, hence, I assumed XXXX XXXX was a legitimate NAVIENT representative. XXXX XXXX proceeded to tell me that the previous representative did not provide an adequate explanation. And so, with more XXXX salesmanship insisted that I should enter into student loan forgiveness as my loan was over XXXX XXXX XXXX and should have been forgiven a long time ago, and that he was the best person to do this as he has XXXX years of experience. Next, he proceeded to say that I needed to make an upfront payment towards my student loan in the amount of USD XXXX, in order to start this process, and that there was an urgency to do this in order to meet the XX/XX/year> deadline. Thus, I explained to him that I was unemployed and what little savings I had was crucial to my survival until I could find employment. XXXX XXXX persisted that this was the best option and he was advocating in my interest to alleviate my concerns about my student loan repayment. Thus, with much reluctance and dismay taking XXXX XXXX at his word as well as believing that the USD XXXX would go towards my student loan payments for XX/XX/year> and XX/XX/year> so that in XX/XX/year> when the U.S. Department of Education determines who qualifies for student loan forgiveness, I would have completed all of the requirements for student loan forgiveness. Hence, I issued an electronic payment in the amount of USD XXXX through a XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXt XXXX XXXX sent to me via email. Once I completed the PSLF/TEPSLF form and submitted payment, XXXX XXXX instructed me to keep him informed of every correspondence so that he could monitor the student loan forgiveness proceedings. 

On XX/XX/year>, the USD XXXX posted to my checking account. However, when I checked my NAVIENT student loan account payment history, I did not see a record of the USD XXXX. I became concerned that this payment did not appear in my NAVIENT payment history. I contacted XXXX XXXX as to the whereabouts of this payment, and he said that it would appear in XXXX once my NAVIENT student loan was consolidated with the U.S. Department of Education. Once I received confirmation from XXXX of my NAVIENT student loan consolidation with the U.S. Department of Education, I created an account, and much to my dismay, there was not a record of the USD XXXX payment towards my student loan. Extremely distraught, I contacted an XXXX representative and shared the backstory of my student loan forgiveness as well as inquired about the missing USD XXXX payment. The XXXX representative kindly informed me that there is not an upfront payment to apply for student loan forgiveness. The XXXX representative grew concerned that I may have fallen victim to a scam. The XXXX representative escalated an investigation into the missing USD XXXX payment which is still ongoing as of this email correspondence. 

Following my many conversations with several XXXX representatives over several weeks, on XX/XX/year>, I, again, contacted XXXX XXXX, and inquired about the missing USD XXXX payment. Through his continuous deceptive tactics, he said that the USD XXXX payment was part of the consolidation amount and not to worry it was there. I pushed back saying that if this was true then there should be a written record with NAVIENT and XXXX with the USD XXXX reflected in the consolidation. XXXX XXXX continued to try to convince me otherwise. But, I was skeptical of his response. 

Distraught and distressed ever more so, on XX/XX/year>, I contacted XXXX again. I spoke with a representative named XXXX, who kindly reiterated that there is not an upfront payment for consideration by the U.S. Department of Education for student loan forgiveness and that this can be done by any individual for free. She advised that unbeknown to me that I could be dealing with a third party broker as third party brokers request a broker fee to process student loan forgiveness. I told her that I initiated this process through NAVIENT and at no time was I informed of working with a third party broker as I was led to believe that XXXX XXXX was an official NAVIENT representative. 

Desperate for the truth and concern that XXXX XXXX appropriated the USD XXXX for his own personal gain at my expense, I, again, called XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/year> and demanded answers about the whereabouts of the USD XXXX, and if he was in fact a third party broker and not a representative of NAVIENT. After many exchanges, XXXX XXXX finally admitted that he was indeed a third party broker explaining that NAVIENT redirects all student loan holders with loans over 20 years directly to third party brokers. Adding insult to injury, XXXX XXXX confessed that the USD XXXX was his broker fee to process and submit my student loan forgiveness application to the U.S. Department of Education.

Profoundly upset and in tears, I said to XXXX XXXX that both he and NAVIENT acted fraudulently forcing me to pay for something that I did not want to pursue in the first place- I contacted NAVIENT with the expressed desire to amend my IDR repayment plan, but instead, XXXX XXXX and NAVIENT had other nefarious intentions. I continued that XXXX XXXX knew that I was unemployed and needed that USD XXXX to pay my bills, keep a roof over my head and survive until I could find employment. I sobbed as I told XXXX XXXX that I was on the verge of losing my home and possessions, and that USD XXXX would be the necessary funds and the only life raft to my imminent survival. XXXX XXXX did not display any empathy, but stood firm in the belief that he did not do any wrong. 

At the conclusion of my conversation with XXXX XXXX, I demanded a refund of the USD XXXX to my account, immediately, along with a written correspondence confirming the refund. He said he would refund my USD XXXX and provide the requested written correspondence, however, with the caveat that he would withdraw my student loan forgiveness application with the U.S. Department of Education.

As of this email correspondence, on XX/XX/year>, I have received neither from XXXX XXXX. And given his duplicity, I do not expect XXXX XXXX to right this wrong and act in good faith. 

Over the last twenty-four hours, I have read countless media reports of NAVIENT 'S XXXX activities with the Federal Trade Commission , U.S. Senators as well as many state Attorney Generals efforts to hold NAVIENT accountable and provide some relief to its innocent victims. I am saddened that even the weight of these governing bodies can not prevent others, such as myself, from falling victim to the predatory student loan industry - An education should not inflict pain and suffering on those trying to build a life. 

As a result of the fraudulent actions of NAVIENT and XXXX XXXX and to prevent this from happening to other innocent student loan borrowers, in reporting this to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, it is my profound hope that you will pursue justice not only for myself, but more importantly, for all who continue to suffer irreparable harm at the hands of those whose self-interest is more important than the greater good. 

Thank you so very much for your kindness and guidance through this incredibly disheartening situation that has left me in a fog of despair.

03/19/24,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"I filed a complaint ( XXXX ) against Navient on XX/XX/24 related to my private student loans, and its response did absolutely nothing to resolve my complaint. 

Per Navient 's instructions in its response, I contacted its call center on XX/XX/24 to "" reevaluate my options '' and was told, again, that there is no deferment or forbearance option available to me, even though I was laid off from my job in XXXX and currently have no income ( I have filed for unemployment benefits but have not received them yet ). I was told that the lowest, interest-only monthly payment available given my circumstances is {$610.00}, which is slightly higher than the payment of {$610.00} quoted in Navient 's response. 

Even if I get the maximum unemployment benefit of {$430.00} per week/ {$1700.00} per month ), it will not cover my housing expenses of {$2100.00} that includes mortgage payment and HOA fees, so paying over {$600.00} per month in student loans is obviously not doable right now. I also have a car payment, credit card bills, medical costs, and support my daughter as a XXXX parent. 

Navient 's refusal to assist me by temporarily lowering or eliminating my student loan payment following an unexpected loss of employment will also ruin my credit score when delinquent payments start getting reported to the credit bureaus at the end of this month, and this will negatively impact my financial situation and my ability to contribute to the local economy for years to come. I can only imagine how many others in a similar situation are out there, and how big of a collective impact these practices make. 

If needed, I will contact the Congressman representing my District ( XXXX XXXX ), as well as my Senators, state representative, and applicable state government agencies and federal/state advocacy organizations to ask for their help in resolving this issue.

Unbeknownst to me at the time, this was a predatory school and since then, has been countlessly found guilty of defrauding its students as evidenced by a sweep of all Federal loans being forgiven to students who attended the schools associated with XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I only received XXXX federal loan for the amount of {$3500.00} in which the balance was ultimately forgiven on XX/XX/XXXX due to the verdict of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX case which the court declared that all individuals who borrowed federal student loans to pay the cost of attendance for any of the XXXX persons named in the Massachusetts Attorney Generals exhibit have the right to borrower defense relief under XXXX C.F.R. XXXX ( c ) ( XXXX ) ( XXXX ) and not related to Then-Attorney General XXXX XXXX lawsuit against XXXX XXXX XXXX 

Unfortunately for me, I had XXXX other loans that were privately owned by Navient, the XXXX XXXX loan and the XXXX XXXX loan, both of which were subprime private loans. Despite the $ XXXX settlement on XX/XX/XXXX against Navient , I did not qualify for that forgiveness either as I was never late for at least seven continuous monthly billing cycles. 

For context, I originally borrowed a total of {$17000.00} which was disbursed in XXXX. From XXXX, I paid Navient a total of {$29000.00} and accrued {$29000.00} in interest. After my interest rate kept fluctuating and went up to 13 % on one loan and 14 % on another in XXXX, I decided to refinance the remaining balance of my loans for {$18000.00} the remaining balance on a {$17000.00} loan from 15 years ago. 

Summary : o Initially borrowed : {$17000.00} o Total payments received from XXXX = {$29000.00} o Total balance refinanced in XXXX = {$18000.00} o Out of pocket payment = {$47000.00} ( payments received + refinanced balance ) o {$29000.00} more than what was initially borrowed ALL interest. 

I have been negatively affected by this because I not only attended a predatory school but also received subprime loans that were designed to never allow me out of debt and despite governments efforts to forgive these loans, I never qualified for its forgiveness.

Despite this, Navient has failed to respond to correspondence sent to corporate headquarters regarding the loan cancellation. Consequently, the company persistently attempts to collect the debt has reported adverse credit information, and has not updated the credit report to reflect paid in full. 

Navient Corporation 's actions are in violation of the following statutes : 15 U.S.C. 1666 ( b ) : Stipulates the timing of payments.

15 U.S.C. 1681 ( a ) : Outlines Congressional findings and the statement of purpose.

15 U.S.C. 1666 ( d ) : Governs the treatment of credit balances.

Additionally, Navient may is in contravention of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) ( 20 U.S.C. 1232g ; 34 CFR Part 99 ) is a Federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. The law applies to all schools that receive funds under an applicable program of the U.S. Department of Education.

FERPA gives parents certain rights with respect to their children 's education records. These rights transfer to the student when he or she reaches the age of XXXX or attends a school beyond the high school level. Students to whom the rights have transferred are "" eligible students. '' Parents or eligible students have the right to inspect and review the student 's education records maintained by the school. Schools are not required to provide copies of records unless, for reasons such as great distance, it is impossible for parents or eligible students to review the records. Schools may charge a fee for copies. 
Parents or eligible students have the right to request that a school correct records which they believe to be inaccurate or misleading. If the school decides not to amend the record, the parent or eligible student then has the right to a formal hearing. After the hearing, if the school still decides not to amend the record, the parent or eligible student has the right to place a statement with the record setting forth his or her view about the contested information. 
Generally, schools must have written permission from the parent or eligible student in order to release any information from a student 's education record. However, FERPA allows schools to disclose those records, without consent, to the following parties or under the following conditions ( 34 CFR 99.31 ) : School officials with legitimate educational interest ; Other schools to which a student is transferring ; Specified officials for audit or evaluation purposes ; Appropriate parties in connection with financial aid to a student ; Organizations conducting certain studies for or on behalf of the school ; Accrediting organizations ; To comply with a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena ; Appropriate officials in cases of health and safety emergencies ; and State and local authorities, within a juvenile justice system, pursuant to specific State law. 

Schools may disclose, without consent, "" directory '' information such as a student 's name, address, telephone number, date and place of birth, honors and awards, and dates of attendance. However, schools must tell parents and eligible students about directory information and allow parents and eligible students a reasonable amount of time to request that the school not disclose directory information about them. Schools must notify parents and eligible students annually of their rights under FERPA. The actual means of notification ( special letter, inclusion in a XXXX XXXX student handbook, or newspaper article ) is left to the discretion of each school.

To date I probably owe them more than what I originally borrowed because their only intent and goal in mind is to make profit out of me, they never offered to help me bring down my balance and instead would put me on plans, deferments, payment plans, etc. that ultimately ruined me, have me unable to purchase a reliable car to drive and scrapping by since my early XXXX, I am now XXXX XXXX XXXX and I, to date, still have very bad memories and experiences with Navient that tarnished my life in a negative way.

Navient ( And Sallie Mae ) have very poor customer service, it is hard to reach them over the phone, nearly impossible to get a representative over the phone unless they are calling to collect from you. Navient, in the past, has reached out to random people that I know to try and get a hold of me. In previous calls, Navient has had my cosigner on the line, listening in to my conversation with them as if trying to ambush me into a worse standing with my co-signer and attempt to collect money from me. Navient ( and Sallie Mae ) have collected payments from me and applied them poorly throughout my multiple loans with them. I vividly remember one year I was required to set up monthly payments, at least for XXXX  months in advance, I had to pay a fee too. After setting up the payments I continued to get harassing calls from them on a regular basis to the point where one time I spoke with a representative and told them I had a payment scheduled for that month ( XXXX ) and asked them to please stop harrassing me, my cosigner and anyone else they had on file as a contact. That same month of XXXX, Navient took out XXXX payments in the same month without my approval, back then, those payments were a very large percentage of my income and I unfortunately had to pay my rent late, borrow money from my mother and miss out on giving my family XXXX gifts. I had to speak with many people to get the duplicate, unauothrized payment refunded to my account, they attempted to deny the refund, they were mean and harrassed me multiple times.

All of the above is current, in the past, when I initially took out my loans, Navient mislead me and my cosigner into getting the majority of my loans as private signature loans that I later found out would benefit them and the school 's recruiter more, financially. It was very unfair because as private loans, I was awarded less rights as a consumer and was heavily targeted and harrassed by navient ( and sallie mae ) 's customer service departments.

Navient has poor transparency surrounding their fees, rates and repayment options. They would not tell me and still don't tell me, whenever they feel like increasing my interest rate. When I first took out the loans, my payments for the private signature loans were around {$450.00}, today, the are around {$650.00}. I don't even think I've been able to decrease my due amount from what I originally borrowed. Navient is a loan shark, they charge a lot of fees to set up payment plans, if you fall behind they are relentless and treated me like garbage. Many times I had a lot of financial hardship with making rent, paying for car repairs, hospital bills, etc. and Navient was very bad to work with on deferments, loan modifications, forbearance or income-driven repayment plans. One time, when I first bought my home I was going through economical hardships because we needed to do a home repair and that repair along with our mortgage amount put me in the negative. When I called customer service to attempt to set up a payment plan, deferment or some sort of financial relief they spent a long time with me on the phone, went over all of my expenses, clearly saw that at the end of month I was spending more money than what I was making and told me that my mortgage payment was a luxury, that I didn't have to buy my home and that it was my fault for buying a home and they would not be able to help me with any income-driven repayment plan or any sort of payment help or option what so ever. It was disgusting to speak with them, go through all of my personal expenses to at the end be told that because I decided to buy a home and better my life they could not help me out.

There was also a period of time where I was going through a lot of economical hardships that I wanted to go through a loan modification with them because the minimum payments I was making were not impacting my balance, they were very deceptive and never wanted to go through loan modifications with me, they would always steer me towards going on deferment until I completely wiped it out as an option, they never told me my options, I always had to plead to them to help me out and I would never get told what my options were.

I hope this is helpful so whomever reads this can be informed of the bad payment mismanagement, poor customer service, lack of transparency, deceptive practices and difficulty obtaining loan modifications that Navient puts people like me under.",None,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",CA,91911,None,Consent provided,Web,04/15/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,8768331

05/24/24,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"Thousands of students were scammed by Navient into taking out predatory private loans to attend for profit online schools such as the one I attended, The XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. As a matter of fact, The XXXX XXXX was investigated into and, due to my attendance there, I have experience extreme hardship and even homelessness. 
Because of the numerous claims of fraud and misconduct perpetrated by these for profit schools, such as The XXXX XXXX, I was able to file a XXXX XXXX claim with the Dept. of Education against The XXXX XXXX, and my Fed. loans of {$79000.00} were discharged and my credit repaired. 
My Borrower Defense Claim was not a part of the Sweet Vs. Cardona settlement but the settlement itself is worth noting to show the state of which the situation has become.

I am aware that Navient was sued by 39 state AGs regarding their predatory loans to attend these for-profit schools and that Sallie Mae/Navient were a "" preferred '' lending company in a "" deal '' with these schools during the early 2000 's. These private loans with a high risk of default were part of a package deal offered to "" for profit online schools ''. But loans made to students in states outside of the agreement, or those who were not in default for 7 months or more during a "" specific '' time frame, were excluded. I am sure this was a big win for Navient, but what a sham of a settlement deal for the rest of borrowers scammed into taking loans to at least XXXX for profit online schools. After the AG settlement, didn't Navient also get out of the Federal student loan business due to scrutiny from lawmakers and borrower advocates? Didn't Navient have to pay restitution to the Federal student loan borrowers for not informing students of XXXX payments students could have enrolled in, but instead steered toward forbearance? Furthermore, hasn't Navient been sued at least a half dozen times for other predatory loan practices and illegal collection practices? 
I am also aware of a "" pilot '' program by which Navient is sending out "" applications '' to select students who may have filed Borrower Defense claims against their schools and were approved. This application is a sham. Why do we need to prove anything? Navient knows who we are. Under the FTC "" Holder Rule '' Navient is liable for giving predatory loans in connection with online for-profit schools. Time is running out for Navient to do right by students who were scammed into taking out private loans to attend online for profit colleges who have committed misconduct and misrepresented themselves to the public to entice students to enroll. Senator Elizabeth Warren has sent a letter to Navient 's CEO asking to discharge these loans NOW! It's time Navient do the right thing and discharge all these predatory private loans made to attend online for profit schools NOW! 
I have been through a lot of hardship due to these loans and was even told that mistakes were made on their end when my loan payments were misallocated which caused one of my loans to default and capitalized interest was applied. This situation put me in a downward spiral and after years of attempting to correct this, I was then coaxed into signing up for NaviRefi, now XXXX. This was also a sham as unnecessary interest was already applied. 
I have called and requested information and the application for discharge due to school misconduct. When I contacted Navient, I was given the usual runaround and redirected over 5 times before someone was able to answer any questions. I asked for the discharge application and was told that there is no such thing. After being redirected further I was then told that there was a document but they refused to send it to me and also refused any sort of reason why.

They asked me to sign them after they went over them without me going through myself and reviewing the documents. Later on when I had transferred I remember having to complete an educational guide on borrowing money for college which I did not go through when enrolling at Ai. In this guide it discussed subsidized and unsubsidized loans and repayment. I'm not sure if regulations had changed from XXXX to XXXX, but this may have made me stop and think and make a different decision. As I was enrolling they brought to my attention that the federal loans I would be receiving were not enough to cover the cost of the school. XXXX made it seem mandatory that we attend school year round for 4 quarters instead of two semesters like a traditional college. I learned later on that student aid only covers so much for the year and if you attend two semesters instead of year round more would be covered for that time frame. However, since they said there wasn't enough to cover tuition they said I should take out Private Loans to cover the difference and that this was common practice when people attend college. XXXX was the only college I had to take out private loans, when I transferred my student aid and federal loans was enough to cover my tuition. 

I had taken two private loans out in XXXX school term for a total of {$21000.00}, one with an interest rate of 11.25 % ( {$15000.00} disbursed on XX/XX/XXXX ) and the other 8.75 % ( {$6300.00} disbursed on XX/XX/XXXX ). Much like student loans I was not required to make payments while XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  however interest was still accruing. The total amount of interest the accrued while I was enrolled through the duration of my education was {$18000.00}. By the time I completed my XXXX XXXX XXXX  my private loans had ballooned to {$40000.00}. This is almost equal to the amount I borrowed for 4 years at a state school. 

It is clear looking back now that XXXX XXXX XXXX along with Navient took advantage of young adults who did not have experience or guidance in making these life decisions.",None,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",PA,152XX,None,Consent provided,Web,05/07/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,8953881

In fact, the attorneys general of several states investigated The XXXX XXXX and their parent company, XXXX, and found them to have acted fraudulently. 

Because of the numerous claims of fraud and misconduct perpetrated by The XXXX XXXX, the Biden administration has just announced a blanket discharge for anyone enrolled at XXXX XXXX XXXX from XX/XX/XXXX, to XX/XX/XXXX. My Federal loans in the principal amount of {$18000.00} were discharged, and my credit was repaired. 

I am aware that Navient was sued by 39 state AGs regarding its predatory loans to attend these online for-profit schools and that Sallie Mae/Navient was a `` preferred '' lending company in a "" deal '' with these schools during the early XXXX. These private loans with a high risk of default were part of a package deal offered to for-profit schools, but loans made to students in states outside of the agreement or those who were not in default for 7 months or more during a "" specific '' time frame, were excluded. 
I am sure this was a big win for Navient, but what a sham of a settlement deal for the other borrowers scammed into taking loans to at least 150 for-profit schools.

Didn't Navient also exit the federal student loan business after the AG settlement due to scrutiny from lawmakers and borrower advocates? Didn't Navient have to pay restitution to the Federal student loan borrowers for not informing students of IDR/IBR payments students could have enrolled in but instead steered toward forbearance? 
Furthermore, hasn't Navient been sued at least a half dozen times for other predatory loan practices and illegal collection practices?

I applied and was given the private loans and finished my degree, albeit in massive debt now mixed Federal and Private. This was always a burden but I made 100 % on-time payments despite that fact. That is until I learned about the DOJ fining the XXXX for {$95.00} XXXX dollars in XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ). This gave me pause because my school was owned and managed by the XXXX. I applied for defense to repayment, and my application was in limbo for a long time. On XX/XX/XXXX I was denied by the XXXX administration of the DoE. Eventually, due to the efforts of XXXX XXXX and some excellent attorneys, I was able to obtain full forgiveness on my federal debt in XXXX, as mentioned above, when the lawsuit was successfully won. A suit that was defended successfully against appeal, over and over again before being finalized. 

Which brings me to today, where I am currently saddled with private debt, consolidated from my original lender, for a degree that has been defamed and trounced upon by the shadow of illegitimacy cast by these settlements and forgiveness. My school is now the punchline of a joke I can't laugh at, indeed I am hesitant to even mention what school I attended at this point, so my degree is a byline of nothing more than past expensive mistakes. 

While I have no qualms about paying back debt for products rendered in fair exchange, this is clearly not such an exchange. The school was found to be culpable in profiting off the backs of students like myself who foolishly sought out unique educational opportunities only to be pressed under the wheel of profiteering gluttony. This has caused the all too common problem of delayed entry into home ownership, slowed progress in all areas of life, and stress and strain in addition to the diminishment of our achievement by the aforementioned shadow of shame now staining our degrees. 

I vehemently dispute that I should have to pay these private loans back, and I would humbly request the remaining debt be cancelled and a refund issued for any funds paid. This won't make up fully for being defrauded of tens of thousands of dollars, nor the over two decades of my life spent in debt, the loss of my degree 's legitimacy, nor the distrust I have for all the involved institutions, but it certainly would be a step in the correct, fair direction.

XXXX XXXX ) I was involved in was finalized. As a result, my federal student loans were canceled. The school was proven to be involved in illegal practices when it comes to student loans. 

A few months ago I contacted Navient about XXXX particular loans that I believe should be canceled under the recent settlement decision. I informed them that these three loans in their possession must have been XXXX loans and as such should be consolidated to Fedloans and then canceled as well. The only loans that I know of were FFLP ( federal loans ) and I have no original documentation on these loans, however they insists that the loans are valid private loans. I then asked for all the documentation on these loans and my signed agreement to them to be sent to me and to freeze the loans until we get to the bottom of this. What they mailed to me was a copy of of some document with no loan details, and an electronic signature. The document they send had no details not even who the lender was, the XXXX, or anything specific. This seems like fraud perpetrated by the school and was being enforced by XXXX and now Navient. 

My credit report is being ruined by these three loans mentioned above and I don't even think they are valid loans. They can't produce any documentation proving they are my loans much less private loans and not XXXX loans. 

Someone needs to investigate this Navient company and situations like this I am sure I am not the only person this is being done to.

I made payments on these loans from the time of my graduation until they were paid off in XXXX. XXXX has been acknowledged by the Department of Education as having engaged in misconduct in recruiting prospective students by claiming higher than actual job placement rates for graduates. I was one of the students that was led to apply in part due to these job placement rates, and I graduated from XXXX in XXXX. I experienced first-hand the lack of jobs available after my graduation and felt taken advantage of by the University. 

I am a class member of the XXXX vs. XXXX lawsuit where the Department of Education has settled with the class offering federal loan forgiveness and refunds of payments made. That process is ongoing. 

I have recently been made aware of a pilot program for school misconduct discharge for private loans by Navient. This program would not only discharge any private loan balance from a school that has engaged in misconduct, but also refund any payments made to Navient on these loans. I called Navient to inquire about this program, and was told that since my loans are at a zero balance, this was not something I was eligible for. 

Given that I attended a school that has been acknowledged by the government to have engaged in misconduct, I should not be penalized or excluded from this program due to having done the right thing and paid off my loans. I should still be eligible for an application, and I believe, a full refund of payments made on these loans. I humbly request that Navient be compelled to provide me with an application for this program. Thank you. 

The attachments to this complaint include the XXXX  XXXX XXXX settlement agreement where XXXX XXXX is listed in Exhibit C as having engaged in misconduct worthy of having my federal loans forgiven and refunded, as well as an email I received from the Department of Education documenting my status as a certified class member entitled for relief as defined by the settlement agreement.",None,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",IL,XXXXX,None,Consent provided,Web,05/06/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,8943643

Furthermore, hasn't Navient been sued at least a half dozen times for other predatory loan practices and illegal collection practices?

Like many other students, I was misled into securing predatory private loans for this "" education. '' My original principal loan amount on my private loans was {$85000.00}. Despite making regular payments on these loans over the last 15 years, my current balance is {$110000.00}. This is due to exorbitant interest rates ranging from 13.5 % to 19 %. To date, I have paid more than {$150000.00} toward these loans. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX  and its parent company, XXXX, were subject to investigations by various state attorney generals and were found to have engaged in deceptive and predatory recruitment practices. In response to these widespread allegations of fraud and misconduct, the Biden Administration recently announced a comprehensive loan discharge for students enrolled at these for-profit scam schools from XX/XX/XXXX, to XX/XX/XXXX. This led to the discharge of my federal loans. 

Navient, which the attorney generals of XXXX states sued for its role in facilitating these predatory private loans, had an arrangement with for-profit schools during the early XXXX, making it a "" preferred '' lender. Despite this lawsuit, the settlement terms provided by Navient were inadequate, as it excluded many borrowers who were coerced into taking these loans to attend for-profit scam schools like XXXX XXXX XXXX  unless they resided in certain states or had not defaulted for at least seven months during a specified period.

The only period during which I could reduce the principal amount on my loans was during the pandemic when interest rates were lowered to between 0.5 % and 1 %. However, once the regular interest rates resumed, my balances quickly accelerated. This financial strain has led me to forgo health procedures, home ownership, and having a child.

Navient has also faced multiple lawsuits for other predatory lending and illegal collection practices. Navient is currently distributing "" applications '' to select students who may qualify for Borrower Defense claims against their schools. However, this process feels intentionally opaque and unnecessary, as Navient knows about the school misconduct and the affected students. I am unable to receive any information as far as eligibility, and the only information I do have is from leaked copies of the School Misconduct Discharge application. Based on these copies, the application requires excessive documentation like correspondence from the school, marketing materials, advertisements, course catalogs, manuals, and school web messaging from loans that are over a decade old. Since then, XXXX  XXXX XXXX has lost its accreditation and closed. The application also threatens borrowers with perjury for providing incomplete information.

Despite this, I requested an application and was told, "" If it is determined you are eligible for further review, in the coming weeks we will mail you an application to submit a claim. '' Again, I do not understand the need for this process or its lack of transparency.

To make matters worse, with the recent news that Navient is exiting the federal student loan servicing business amidst legislative and advocacy scrutiny following allegations of steering borrowers away from income-driven repayment plans towards forbearance, I am concerned that the application process for a discharge based on school misconduct is an attempt to defer action until MOHELA takes control of their loans.

Under the FTC 's "" Holder Rule, '' Navient is accountable for these predatory loan issues associated with for-profit scam schools. As time is critical, Senator XXXX XXXX has urged Navient 's CEO to discharge these loans immediately. As she stated in her letter, "" Given XXXX  failure to follow guidance on canceling predatory federal loans, it is hard to believe that it will behave any better in canceling similar private loans Navient will transfer to them.

I completed a thorough document they mailed to me as well as provided documentation and back up, I took this application as serious of a matter as the XXXX application, provided almost the same exact answers to each question they asked, the federal application was approved months ago but Navient denied mine in XXXX and did not provide a reason for the denial. 

Navient knows this school has been proven to have engaged in misconduct and should dismiss my student loans without the need for me to fill out a very long and complicated document that has no clear indication from Navient as to what the requirements are, how they determine if XXXX is or is not eligible for this dismissal or not. 

It is unfair and unethical of Navient to know that misconduct has been proven for this school but denied my application for dismissal.
