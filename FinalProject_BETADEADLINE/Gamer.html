<div class="text">
<h1>By Tyler Lochte, Colin McMarinara, and Ryan Cosobono</h1>

<p>Jeff Fuentes found space and let it fly. It was bobbled by the goalie of Garrincha’s Goats, and out of the chaos in the box the ball struck the net. From the bench, there was no way of knowing who scored, but as the team ran to the corner, it soon became clear.</p>

<p>It was Tyler Lochte, the captain, who got the touch and scored the first non-scrimmage regulation goal of his four-year career. Despite playing only sparingly after, his teammates voted him Mouse of the Match in a 2-1 Round One win for No. 22 BTN Rovers over the No. 11 Goats on Tuesday.</p>  

<p>“I got the ball on a silver platter,” said Lochte to team reporter Colin McMarinara after the match. “My eyes just got so wide. I’m just so happy I could help the team.”</p>

<p>“I felt like a proud dad,” said Sam Yeo, who chased down Lochte at the corner flag alongside Dash Tischler and Ethan Fabyan.</p> 

<p>The moment left CEO and club owner Mr. Brian Melanson stunned.</p>

<p>“I needed video confirmation. I actually did not believe it,” said the boss after he saw the finish for himself. </p>

<p>After Lochte’s goal, the Mice were asking all of the questions in the first half, peppering the Garrincha’s Goats goal. They finally found a second when Cris Martinez won the ball at midfield, worked a nice one-two with Fuentes, and beat the goalie with a tidy finish to the far post, doubling the Mice advantage.</p>

<p>“It was a toe-ball,” said Martinez on his finish, “but you know, what works works if it gets the job done.”</p>

<p>It’s the first goal contribution from Martinez since the scrimmage, where he scored four and assisted two. For Fuentes, he collected his second assist of the season for his fourth goal contribution. </p>

<p>Fuentes emphasized that the strong start was needed after a collapse in the final regular season game saw the team plummet down the standings.</p>

<p>“We had a shaky end to our last regular season game,” said Fuentes, “but [tonight], we started off strong against a really, really good team. I’m happy with the performance.”</p>

<p>At halftime, the message from Lochte was for the defense to step up. For the first 10 minutes of the half it was Garrinacha’s Goats who had the chances, but the defense stood firm. </p>

<p>With 15 minutes to go, Colby “The Goalie” Stevens threw his body in front of a shot from close range and saw it go out for a corner. The Goats finally got their goal when Ethan Reedy beat Stevens to get one back for the heavy favorites. It was the first goal conceded in open play by the Mice since March 12. </p>

<p>And that was it, the final shot the Goats recorded as the Mice found a way to kill off the rest of the game. Defensive Midfielder Martins Okorie owed this success to trust, confidently proclaiming, “I’m like a loose dog charging every time a ball comes near our side.” </p>

<p>When beat reporter Ryan Cosobono asked Andrew Diveley about the back line’s success, the sweeper said, “Communication and composure. We know what we’re doing. We play the same way every game.”</p>

<p>While the play on the pitch exuded passion and heart, the bench unit’s energy radiated throughout the Mouse House. Chief Vibes Officers ‘Swaggy’ Steve Jacobs and Ethan ‘Schmiel’ Schmiel led the mob. Whether it was Martinez and Lochte’s magnificence on the field, or the pitter-patter of Jacob’s griddy down the sideline, the Goats could not escape the Mice lust for victory.</p>

<p>After the match there was some controversy, when a stray question from a reporter unaffiliated with the team accused captain Lochte of publicly claiming the team would lose. Cosobono, who also acts as the team’s SID, quickly dealt with the radical reporter and question, as the press conference continued.</p>

<p>The Mice will play again on Monday at 11 p.m., as they face No. 6 Top 5 in the Round of 16. It is Name on the Front Night at the Mouse House, with planned activities including the return of several Mice alumni, such as Chris Roebuck and Terra Oh. </p></div>
