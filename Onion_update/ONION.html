            The Catholic Church elected Cardinal Robert Prevost on Thursday, May 8, making him the 266th pope in history. He chose the name Leo XIV. Pope Leo XIV was the first pope to come from the United States. On Friday, He was interviewed about his alma mater, Villanova, and their new men's basketball head coach, Kevin Willard.

          <h4>"I learned of Coach Willard during March Madness, and I remember him taking the media attention away from his talented team during their run. I was disappointed when he left Maryland after they had been eliminated to join Villanova."</h4>

              <p>Maryland's <a href="https://x.com/LimNeeson/status/1890520994923659562" target="_blank">"Crab Five"</a> inspired Pope Leo XIV to leave Rome before the conclave began to visit the school. He stopped by to see the team and bless Buzz Williams and his new staff, and, of course, he had to visit his buddy Testudo for good luck.</p>

          </div>

          <p>To the surprise of many, Pope Leo XIV brought out Coach Willard when introducing himself to the crowd surrounding the Vatican. Despite previously stating his disappointment with Willard, he embraced his fellow Villanova man in front of the world.</p>

          <p>Speaking on his decision to bring Willard into the Vatican, Pope Leo XIV said, "God holds no grudges. While I disagree with the decision and how he handled himself, he remains a representative of my alma mater so I will support him. I understand my actions may disappoint my good friend Testudo, but I hope he will understand."</p>

              <p>Back in College Park, Testudo was heartbroken to see the pope embracing Willard soon after their visit. Sources at the school say he participated in Saturday's senior bar crawl to "drown his sorrows."</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>Williams suggested that Maryland and Villanova schedule a game early next season to square off but with a twist. "After the Pope's actions, I want to challenge Coach Willard to put Maryland on his schedule next year, but the game will be played at the Vatican."</p>

        <!-- Second pull quote -->
        <div class="pull-quote">
          <h4>"We were blessed by the pope and then publicly spurned. This is bigger than basketball. This is biblical."</h4>
          <h3>—Buzz Williams</h3>
        </div>

        <div class="article-type">
      
          <p>Williams, also a man of faith, compared Willard's antics to Judas Iscariot. "When I saw how Willard treated his players and school on his way out, especially during the season of Lent, I couldn't help but think of Judas and how he treated Jesus Christ in his final days."</p>

          <p>The ball is now in Willard's court. He has the opportunity to go back to the school he left in an ugly fashion, without having to travel to College Park. Bringing college basketball to Vatican City would be unprecedented, but would signal the impact of an American-born man being elected as pope.</p>

          <p>Williams hopes to get the opportunity to prove he is the greater coach in front of the pope and the world.</p>

          <p>"A creature as glorious as Testudo should never have to feel so down," said Williams. "A win for our team would restore the feeling of honor to our beloved mascot."</p>
